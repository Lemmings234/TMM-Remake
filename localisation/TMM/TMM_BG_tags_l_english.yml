 POLITICS_TENZIN_GYATSO_DESC:0 "Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso or Tenzin Gyatso for short, the 14th and current Dalai Lama is both the spiritual and de facto ruler of Tibet. Destined to carry on the legacy of Dalai Lama before him, the young ruler however has greater aspiration than just monasteries and life of hermits. Since his childhood Tenzin Gyatso has also found interest in science and modern technologies brought in by the British. Such is the influence of the outside world onto the young man that he, a top figure of a semi-feudal nation would adhere to the preachings of Karl Marx, finding common ground between Marxism and Buddhism in their advocation for an equal society. Now TIbet extends its rule deep into the Azure Sea, establishing itself as a regional powerhouse, but this control is growing ever fragile. At home, Tenzin Gyatso find his push for modernisation efforts to strengthen Tibet has fallen into deaf ears. Abroad, the Ma Clique and the Chinese is growing ever vengeful about the loss of Yushu. \n\nClock is ever ticking, but the progressive mind find himself encased in an ancient system refusing to give in."

 POLITICS_SHENG_SHICAI_DESC:0 "The Second Sino-Japanese War brought sudden changes to all of China, for good or evil. Beyond the long treks of Hexi however, life simply carried on. With no invaders in sight, the reign of Sheng Shicai, King of Sinkiang seems blissfully ignorant of the outside world, but one thing is certain - His miraculous statesmanship is the only thing keeping this ethnic cocktail of a province afloat. \n\nMost warlords during the 1920s and 1930s usually either find support in his home province, or band himself with allies, be they graduates of Baoding or Whampoa. The Dongbei-born, Japanese-educated political economist however certainly stood out. Looking for military experiences, Sheng served as aide under many famous figures, including Zhang Zuolin and the Generalissimo.\n\nAppointed to Sinkiang with his bitter rival Ma Zhongying to oversee the precarious border, Sheng's education of politicking paid back greatly, as he was able to ally with the White Russians and oust both Jin Shuren and Ma Zhongying, rising to the position of §YDuban§!, or military governer. \nSince 1937, Sheng Shicai's rule solidified the province by carefully balancing external and internal stakeholders, the greatest of which being the USSR. During the 1940s, Sinkiang became more or less an autonomous SSR of the Union, with thousands of rubles, 'advisors' and guns flowing in all without Chinese supervision.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapased under the weight of Axis, Sheng, who was never a true communist, quickly turned on the Union and seeked aid from Japan as funds for his grand project of ethnic unity drained dry. The Empire, who was more than willing to destabilise Northwestern warlords paid the King dearly to put Sinkiang out of Chinese coalition.\n\nNow Sheng reaps the benefits of working with the Sphere: The Uyghurs are content, the Communists thoroughly extinguished, the province prospering. \nTruly, Sheng's rule is one with the land,\n\n§RAnd the Province's paperweight is Sheng Shicai§!."
