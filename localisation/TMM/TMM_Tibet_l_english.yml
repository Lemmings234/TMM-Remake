 POLITICS_TENZIN_GYATSO_DESC:0 "Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso or Tenzin Gyatso for short, the 14th and current Dalai Lama is both the spiritual and de facto ruler of Tibet. Destined to carry on the legacy of Dalai Lama before him, the young ruler however has greater aspiration than just monasteries and life of hermits. Since his childhood Tenzin Gyatso has also found interest in science and modern technologies brought in by the British. Such is the influence of the outside world onto the young man that he, a top figure of a semi-feudal nation would adhere to the preachings of Karl Marx, finding common ground between Marxism and Buddhism in their advocation for an equal society. Now TIbet extends its rule deep into the Azure Sea, establishing itself as a regional powerhouse, but this control is growing ever fragile. At home, Tenzin Gyatso find his push for modernisation efforts to strengthen Tibet has fallen into deaf ears. Abroad, the Ma Clique and the Chinese is growing ever vengeful about the loss of Yushu. \n\nClock is ever ticking, but the progressive mind find himself encased in an ancient system refusing to give in."
