However, as early polling showed Anderson losing the Iowa Caucuses due to being, in one voter's words, "too boring", Anderson pivoted to primarily advocating for electoral reforms, including instant-runoff voting, fairer rules for independent candidates, popular election of Presidents, and proportional representation in legislative elections.

These tensions exploded into a full-scale war as the Karelian Liberation Army rose up against their Finnish occupiers. Russian ground forces swiftly moved in to secure the region but were met with fierce Finnish resistance. After intense fighting across a vast front, the Karelian government finally collapsed, decisively ending the conflict with a firm Finnish victory and delivering a brutal loss to Russian forces in Europe.\n\nWith this victory, the Reich stands triumphant over Russia once more. Whether it can maintain its dominance, remains to be seen. \n"
