In a great irony, the central government of the §BKuomintang§! shall follow the same path they have forced the Communists to walk a decade ago in their grand retreat into the west. In an effort to keep the regime afloat, most organs of the Nationalist Government are essentially defunct, leaving the Legislative Yuan as one of the two parliamentary chambers left.

 DECISION_EFFECT_BOG_Ability_COM:0 "'Homemade Tanks' are what the Communists refer to as makeshift armoured vehicles.

 DECISION_EFFECT_BOG_Ability_SOC:0 "While we have been gathering all loyal citizens to our cause and hastily training and equipping them with gears of war, the war drags on. Through centralisation offers us a degree of efficiency, the Southern Barracks are built too far away from the heart of the battle.\n\nThe Communists, hiding between old alleys offer an alternative. Secret basement training centers have been set up all around the city. While it would mean those from such backgrounds would lack many means including aspects of basic weapon training, grenades, molotovs, and sharp Dadaos may yet prove useful in Golmud. Let us not waste this opportunity.\n\n§YWhen activated, militia units would rise up in certain areas in 5 groups of 125 men that could potentially help capture certain areas.

 DECISION_EFFECT_BOG_Ability_CDL:0 "The Minority in China has always played a noteworthy role in its military history dating back to the dynastic eras. Even to this point, we could rally them under our banners. Though some see the Golmud government as elitist at best, it is a government actively attempting to transform their lives for the better, as shown in the past. Ningxia Ma however has barely any relation with these people and is considered more foreign than those of Qinghai.

Amidst the chaos when men swear fealty to ideals, distant are their dreams, and yet close is the money of the Kung-Soong families. If ambitions can flip allegiance, hard currency can do it again. We have heard of plans of Ma Dunjing to fortify his Northern Barracks to the teeth while sending messages to other Ningxia units to join the fight. Though unassailable by conventional means, warfare has always been... unconventional.\n\n§YWhen activated, Reduce the defensive advantage in the Northern Barracks by 5%.§!"
 DECISION_EFFECT_BOG_Ability_ZXX:0 "It is said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, yet the Chinese have learned to also understand the pen is no less inferior in the art of manipulation. As the modern age approaches, new forms of communication only make it easier for organisations to advocate their beliefs and agendas publicly. One such group is the Free China association, one that has always been seen as rogue by the mainstream Kuomintang. Yet fleeing from their office they bring with them broadcasting equipment that could prove invaluable. Even if our enemies attempt to humanise themselves, nonstop bombardment of propaganda will surely decide the battle over minds.\n\n§YWhen activated, Increase§! §BAllied influence§! §Yin every single node by 10%§!

With aid from OFN forces through §R|REDACTED|§!, new samples of these steel beasts have been acquired.
