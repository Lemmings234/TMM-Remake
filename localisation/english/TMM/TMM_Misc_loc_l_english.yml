 ###POLITICS AND MILITARY DESC###

 POLITICS_MA_JIYUAN_DESC:0 "Ma Jiyuan was always destined for greatness, and he achieved it. At least, as great as any minor warlord could be.\n\nBorn into the long line of Hui Muslim bureaucrats and warlords, Ma Jiyuan grew up in a pious lifestyle overshadowed by the war, suffering and poverty pervading Qinghai.\n\nPractically a child general, he attended Whampoa and served against the Japanese, Ma never quite ended the fight. As provinces buckled and an unsteady peace took eastern China, Ma, a stalwart defender of the old Kuomintang, smuggled out refugees and former generals, committing small raids into Tsuji's territory and never giving the Japanese a chance to retaliate.\n\nHowever, time is catching up to Ma, and the problems of the modern world will not stop at the Ma Clique. Ma Jiyuan has been forced to make compromises as challenges to his rule emerge. The great defender of Sun Yat-Sen's vision still shines, but he dims everyday. "

 POLITICS_NATIONAL_ASSEMBLY_DESC:0 "With the resignation of Ma Jiyuan as the Extraordinary President of the Republic of China, the National Assembly, an organisation representing the people of Qinghai have temporarily taken over to act as a quasi governing council, when Legislative Yuan fell into chaos. The Kuomintang and the Communists lost their common cause, and it won't take long till a winner shall be decided."

 POLITICS_ZHU_JIAHUA_DESC:0 "§YTemporary President of the Republic of China§!\n§BKuomintang§! - §gZhu Jiahua Clique§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 30th May 1893 \nWuxing County, Huzhou, Zhejiang Province§! \n\nFollowing the collapse of Sun Fo's presidency, the Kuomintang once more falls into disarray. And for this, they will need someone loyal to the Kuomintang, while maintaining distances with all major factions. Zhu Jiahua of Zhejiang is elected by an ad hoc meeting despite his chronic sickness.\n\nA geologist by trade, Zhu Jiahua did not interfere with politics till the Northern Expedition, perhaps out of hope that the new, expanding administration could use him in some higher-up positions. And Zhu got what he asked. Within five years, Zhu, as a novus homo of Chinese politics was the president of the National Central University, a member of the Academia Sinica and the Chairman of Zhejiang. However, all of these prestigious titles are paled by the Director of Zhongtong, with the unanimous support of the Chen Brothers.\n\nDespite Chens' backing, Zhu's desire for power eventually resulted in the formation of a new CC Clique under Zhu, which often clashed with Chens' Old CC Clique. With Chiang Ching-kuo and Wang Shijie dominating the political landscape, Zhu's temporal presidency seems to reflect Kuomintang's current situation."

 POLITICS_SUN_FO_DESC_TMM:0 "§YPresident of the Republic of China§!\n§BKuomintang§! - §gZaizao Clique§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 20th October 1891 \nXiangshan County, Guangdong Province§! \n\nWhen the Middle Kingdom falls into peril, who shall answer the cry of millions of people for the foundation of a national state? When such a regime is broken by foreign aggressors, who shall stand between the total annihilation of China and its foes, however numerous, powerful and almighty?\n\nIt seems that the son of the man that started the revolution shall see it completed. Prestige of his family offers him more opportunities, but it has also placed uncountable pressure upon him. Everywhere he goes, journalists will compare Dr Sun the Younger to his father; Every decision he makes, the people would judge him not based on what he achieved, but on what the Founding Father did. Sun withdrew himself from politics, for he lost in political struggles. Even within his fragile alliance, the opposition seems to lurk around every corner. But it seems that he is doomed to be followed by his father's legacy. Elected president, Sun Fo returns from California with the aid of OFN agents.\n\nSun Fo's life is forever shadowed by Sun Yat-sen, and it is likely that even after his death, the entire family shall carry the burden of their forerunners. And for that, Sun weeps."

 MILITARY_DU_YUMING_DESC:0 "§YBorn 28th November 1904 \nMizhi County, Yulin, Shaanxi Province§! \n\nDu Yuming, the commander of the nonexistant 5th Military Region is a complicated man. To some, he is the first Chinese miliary leader to command a fully armored division. His usage of armor and innovative tactics defeated even the best men Japan could offer. His campaign in Burma fended off the Japanese for months despite his inferior number and equipment. However, his disatrous march from Burma back to China was just as well known as his victories, almost costing him his military career. \n\nSince 1920s Du has been involved in the military, but unlike most others Du kept some distance from the pestilence that is political interference, and tried to maintain his focus on military matters. And soon came a test for the Whampoa graduate.\n\nThroughout the course of the war Du spent most of his time in southern China, and then towards the west to defend British Burma. Despite initial successes, the Chinese were unable to mount a proper defense with their severely weakened British allies and Du's force was essentially chased out of Burma's lush forests by the Japanese and their Indian collaborators. It is made further clear to Du that war would not be neccessarily in China's favour when the Japs completely overran Burma, and that fortifying Yunnan along with General Long Yun is all he could to buy time. \n\nBut the general found even Yunnan undefendable, despite its natural terrain. General Lu Han's untimely betrayal foiled Du and Long's plans, turning the mountainous Yunnan from the fortress of Southwest to their grave. Du narrowly escaped capture by Lu's men and fled for Sichuan, only to have it soon captured too. It almost seems as if Du brings a curse with him, bound to ruin every attempt of him in defending China. \n\nBut being not the superstitious type, after 1947 Du arrived in Xining with but a few companies left, a fraction of the armies he once led. Now with nowhere to run, Du is determined to not go down without a fight."

 MILITARY_YE_JIANYING_DESC:0 "§YBorn 28th April 1897 \nMei County, Meizhou, Guangdong Province§! \n\nOne does not have to be born in Shizu families to be a great leader, and this is especially true for Ye Jianying, one of the finest thinker of the Communist Party, and perhaps all of China. A battle hardened Communist, he was there when the Kuomintang hunted them down. He was there when Zhang Guotao almost split the Red Army in half. He was there in Xi'an. Despite being a career officer, Ye is involved in nearly every major event in the Party, be it military or not, representing the army and working out differences. And as such he is highly respected in the Communist Party and even the Kuomintang as a 'moderate' of some sort, able to broker the parties as much as he can bring men to victories. Ye firmly believes Mao's theory of protracted warfare, and as such never seeks to engage the enemy on field battles when any other commander would. Some may say it is simply cowardice, but in any other instances the Red Army and China in general have only seen defeat. \n\nYe Jianying is no fervent attacker, but one thing is sure - All fervent attacks can be annulled with impregenable defences.\n\n§RThough his prestige in the CCP is high and he holds deep regards to Mao's theories, it seems Mr. Ye... does not necessarily agree with some of Party's political guidelines, especially those concerning our stance on the enemy of proletariat as he should..."

 MILITARY_GUO_JIQIAO_DESC:0 "§YBorn 14th November 1902 \nHefei County, Luzhou Prefecture, Anhui Province§! \n\nBeing one of the few officers graduating from Baoding rather than Whampoa, it does not take one long to guess the things Guo Jiqiao has been through. From a humble platoon commander to the 5th Military Region, Guo rised through the ranks rapidly and by age 35 he is already one of the youngest senior military personnel in all of China, spearheading the defence of Northern China that bought the central government much time to prepare itself for the coming storm. For years after years, his army held Shaanxi firmly, not yielding an inch of land till Fu's sudden capitulation devastated Du's 5th and Hu Zongnan's 1st Military Region to a scale comparable to the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing in 1937. Guo and Du formed the rear formation protecting those fleeing West, soldiers and civilians alike. However, with the Taihang line compromised, Japanese forces were free to roam the plains beyond. And thus fell Tianshui, Lanzhou and Liangzhou. One by one, marking the total occupation of the 18 Provinces of Han. The horde was finally stopped by the determined 5th Military Region and Qilian Mountains equally imposing, bringing a period of watchful peace between the two sides. But it is obvious the peace between two sides will not last long. Raids by both sides are common, and skirmishes frequent. \n\nBefore that day comes, Guo and his men must ensure no Japanese boot will ever step on the other side of Qilian Mountains, lest Xining, the City of Western Peace, fall." 

 MILITARY_MU_SHENGZHONG_DESC:0 "§YBorn ?th October 1910 \nKoujiayuan, Wubao County, Shaanxi Province§! \n\nBorn out of peasntry, Mu's family was too poor to record down on which day he was born. But this did not stop him from being one of the most famous young Communists. He was known as Mu the Bold, establishing key Communist holdouts that would be later critical for Mao's army to rest and nurture itself. And that his survey and subsequent Founding of Golmud further crowns him with an aura of glory. When nobody would bother or dare adventure into the plateau, Mu did and did a terrific job with almost no supply to speak of. Without Mu Shengzhong's efforts, Qinghai would have to be stuck with Xining and thus forever under the shadow of Hui. Golmud may not be the most beautiful city out there, but everyone know it is the best chance they can ever get, and this second chance was brought forth entirely by Comrade Mu. Thus Mu is one of the only few Communists earning universal love from Qinghai, and to this day he is used as a propaganda tool. But Mu isn't that sort of men content to stay on posters, even when his body grows older by the days. His great treks cover almost the entirety of Qinghai Plateau, everywhere Mu and his men ride by under the Red Banner, one more patch of land would be recorded down in Golmud, one more piece of land that China can utilise, one more bit of resource China can acquire in its ultiamte battle."

 MILITARY_MA_JIYUAN_DESC:0 "§YBorn 8th January 1921 \nHezhou, Gansu Province§! \n\nMa Jiyuan was always destined for greatness, and he achieved it. At least, as great as any minor warlord could be.\n\nBorn into the long line of Hui Muslim bureaucrats and warlords, Ma Jiyuan grew up in a pious lifestyle overshadowed by the war, suffering and poverty pervading Qinghai.\n\nPractically a child general, he attended Whampoa and served against the Japanese, Ma never quite ended the fight. As provinces buckled and an unsteady peace took eastern China, Ma, a stalwart defender of the old Kuomintang, smuggled out refugees and former generals, committing small raids into Tsuji's territory and never giving the Japanese a chance to retaliate.\n\nHowever, time is catching up to Ma, and the problems of the modern world will not stop at the Ma Clique. Ma Jiyuan has been forced to make compromises as challenges to his rule emerge. The great defender of Sun Yat-Sen's vision still shines, but he dims everyday. "
 MILITARY_ZHANG_FAKUI_DESC:0 "§YBorn 2nd September 1896 \nQinghua, Shixing County, Nanxiong Prefecture, Guangdong Province§! \n\nThe Commander of the 4th Military Region is as rebellious as the province of Guangdong, and yet a stalwart defender of the Three Principles bolder than any other men. It is hard to believe that Zhang Fakui, who valiantly defended China would have a long record of Anti-Chiang activities from the very begining when Chiang acquired absolute powers. \n\nLike many Guangdong generals, Zhang is a seasoned revolutionary from the very start, and yet his intentions still mysterious. \n\nZhang is no model Kuomintang - He'd protect Communist subordinates when every other army was in a White Terror fever. And when Chiang ordered him to hunt those Reds down, Zhang simply watched Ye Jianying, He Long and Ye Ting escape. \nZhang is also no Communist - 1927's coup end up a disgraced Zhang running from Bukharin sponsored CCP uprisings. \n\nWhat is certain that Zhang is a great leader, and one that knows to drop his political grudges in the hour of unity. Zhang's 8th Army Group ensured every step Japanese Army took was soaked deep in their countrymen's blood, but such defence costed the Chinese just as much. Shanghai wouldn't be his last battle, though. Zhang's men fought to the last men defending the streets of Wuhan and hilly suburbs of Chongqing, prolonging the war as much as he can. Though Japan stands victorious, she is only a little less shattered than China's corpse, and Zhang believes he has done just enough for Japan to fall onto itself in the coming years."

 ###MINISTER DESC###

 QIN_Chiang_Chingkuo_hog_desc: "§YPresident of the Legislative Yuan§!\n§gOld Kuomintang§! - §YParty-State System§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 27th April 1910 \nXikou, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province§! \n\nThe only biological son of the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek (the other son being adopted), Chiang Ching-kuo is often described as the symbol of old Kuomintang. In a party as nepotistic as the Nationalist Party, Chiang is expected to involve himself in politics and take the helm of the Republic from old Chiang. At age 25, Chiang Ching-kuo was sent to Bukharinist Russia to study during a short period of KMT-CCP cooperation, where he would marry, learn Russian and political matters. However, Generalissimo's purge of Communists in the April 12 Incident quickly led to the younger Chiang becoming a virtual political hostage of Bukharin. Returning from the USSR in 1937, Chiang distanced himself from Marxism, and began taking more important administrative positions on the government. In Jiangxi, one of the poorest provinces of China, Chiang Ching-kuo distinguished himself by effectively rooting out corruption, iliteracy and opium at an impressive rate. From these backwater places he would learn how to effectively deal with people and reform China.\n\nBut Jiangxi would certainly be of insignificant aid to China when the Japanese invaded. Chiang followed his father to Chongqing, but instead of staying in the city, Chiang Kai-Shek ordered his son to cease pointless sacrifices and lead the Kuomintang remnants and retreat for the Northwest, where he would meet up with Hu Zongnan and his betrayed forces. \n\nWith his sheer influence by heritage and support of people, Chiang Ching-kuo is a political giant in Qinghai, and it seems Chiang's power would not weather away anytime soon."
 
 QIN_Wang_Shijie_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs§!\n§BZhengxuexi§! - §YNeoconfucian Liberalism§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 10th March 1891 \nChongyang County, Wuchang Prefecture, Hubei Province§! \n\nHubei is often thought to be the heart of the Chinese Revolution. The lands north of the great lake watched the reactionaries bring about the Eight Nations to China. It is the first province to declare independence against the decadent Qing, and it is here the great industries of China stood, fueling the revolution, however a failure it is. Wang Shijie, an intellectual faithful to the true China is amongst the last of Hubei still fighting the Revolution. \n\nAn educator and lawmaker by trade, his ardent support of Chiang Kai-Shek and his skill of negotiation made him the foreign minister - or in other words, the most useless post in Qinghai. Despite Wang's seemingly status of a puppet, his strings reach way further than he ever could as a diplomat. Representing the §Bconservative branch of the Section of Political Science§! in the government, Wang is both part of the government through his support of the young Chiang and the opposition in the party. \n\nIt would then appear that Wang is a negotiator, brokering the factions to keep the Kuomintang afloat, but it is also far from truth. For every deal he makes, Wang ensures power is steadily transferred to him and his clique. Those half-broke Communists and illiterate soldiers know nothing about China. Only those educated and accredited to rule shall govern and only then shall China endure."
 
 QIN_Ji_Chaoding_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economic Affairs§!\n§RCCP§! - §NNew Democracy§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 9th October 1903 \nFenyang County, Shanxi Province§! \n\nIn countries like China know-how is more precious than gold, then for men like Ji Chaoding, one word indeed worth ten thousand. Like many other leaders of the Nationalist Party, Ji's family background was not poor, but well known in the province. Influenced by Western thoughts and systems from young, and his family's tradition of treating the peasantry with dignitiy furthers young Ji's desire to go out and see the 'civilised' world. \n\nAnd he got his chance. \n\nSent to the Big Apple for education hopping from Chinese universities to the ones in the States, Ji was renowned for his rousing speeches to Americans and Chinese alike, but more importantly his understanding of economics and his status as a Columbia graduate. As the Empire of Japan invaded China, Ji felt a need to return to China, and use his knowledge and his connections to the US to help reconstruct China for better. Now cut off from outside support and facing an rural economy in utter ruin, Ji has much to do. \n\nNowadays few bureaucrats can do as much as Ji does while being clean and honest, indeed the silent workhorse of the Nationalist Government.\n\n§RHowever Ji would not comment about his membership of the Communist Party USA and why he'd spent so many years in Yan'an before joining the Government...§!"
 
 QIN_Shen_Zhiyue_sec_desc: "§YMinister of the Interior§!\n§gOld Kuomintang§! - §gChiang Kai-Shek Thought§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 18th Feburary 1913 \nXiage, Xianju County, Zhejiang Province§! \n\nThe Nationalists were 'renowned' for their utter inability to combat internal infiltrations by Communists and the Japs alike §Wsave for Dai Li's men§!. It would not be surprising then that Shen, the spymaster of Qinghai is handpicked by Director Dai himself. A quiet man on surface, Shen has learnt that one should always keep eyes wide open and his mouth dead shut. \n\nFluent in Russian, English and everything about Bukharinism, Shen is the only men to have successfuly infiltrated the Communists, and to achieve success. He'd met Mao and Zhou in Yan'an. He'd apply to join the CCP, and join he did by the recommendation of Kang Sheng himself. He'd use his masterful knowledge of Communism and the CCP to hunt down local leaders, but when the Communists come to root him out, Shen'd stay silent and out of radar for years, under the nose of China's most seasoned intelligence organisation.\n\nKnowing himself, Shen chose to escape before the Communists'd use his captured associates to get him too. With him, countless information on the CCPs.\n\nBy 1941 Shen is one of Dai's closest confidants, leading and educating new spies for Himmler of the Orient. Before death, Dai Li, again showing his deep trust, appointed Shen to lead Juntong. \n\nSince 1957 Shen Zhiyue is the undisputed leader of Chinese intelligence. Although his past made Communists steered away from incorporation of certain information, they nonetheless acknowledges the abilities. \n\n§RShrouded in utmost darkness, Shen Zhiyue and his men are without face save for few. His patience is unparalleled, and his knowledge on the enemy is vast. Know thy enemy and thyself...§!"

 QIN_Dao_Shengyang_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economic Affairs§!\n§BKuomintang§! - §NNonpartisan§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 1919\nNanchang County, Jiangxi Province§!\n\nFor a specific group as active and politically sought after as western-educated economists, Dao Sheng-yang can be seen to live in its periphery due to him refraining from practical politics. Yet, he was pulled into the levers of power for this reason, as the Kuomintang-Communist coalition unanimously chose him to serve as Minister of Economic Affairs.\n\nA frequent visitor of Xikang and Sichuan as a treasury official, Dao was involved in many key negotiations concerning trade agreements between Xikang and Qinghai, and was responsible for drafting a secret document together with Xiong of Sichuan. The 1954 Memo approved by the Sichuanese and Qinghai governments guaranteed the flow of trade between the Sichuan basin and the Northwest. If it wasn't for Dao's continued efforts, the north-western regime might have broken down years ago. Now, at the helms of Qinghai's economy, Dao continues to heavily emphasize trades with the eastern collaborator governments and extracting favourable terms on them by whatever means possible. As much as the Coalition hates the idea, it is the only realistic solution that would enable their counterattack later on, and for now the consensus holds helped along by Dao's nonpartisanship."

There Sun independently led a series of projects moving entire power plants from the eastern coast into Sichuan and then into Qinghai, where he oversaw construction to build another one. At the age of 33, Sun is already tasked with repairing and transporting the Sichuanese industry to Xikang and Qinghai, a job he executed so well that the power grid of Free China has yet to collapse, despite what the Japanese have projected and cementing Sun's own reputation as a widely beloved visionary-- a true industrial wizard. With the full backing of Chiang Ching-kuo and the state stabilising, Sun is ready to use what is available with maximum efficiency to transform Qinghai and the entirety of the Northwest from a poor backwater of China to a true powerhouse of industry."

 GUZ_Li_Pinxian_hog_desc: "Li Pinxian was never supposed to be anyone in the Gui Clique. A Hunnan warlord seeking refuge in Guangxi, he was first and foremost an outsider to the Liangguang. If it wasn't for Huang Qixiang's public criticism of Li Zongren's actions that led to his eventual downfall, he would be likely to remain as a general than a supreme leader, and yet here he is. Taking over the legacy of Li Zongren, Pinxian climbed all the way to the position of vice-chairman of the Xinan Political Commission. As the first Gui leader to visit Kunming since the feud between the factions, it is assumed that he would play the role of a negotiator, softening up with the Dian Clique and changing the Isolationism of Li Zongren. After all, since Long Yun's days are numbered, it could be helpful to Yunnan-Guangxi relations in the future, perhaps even allowing the two to regain their old strength and rival that of Nanjing. For now, though, these remain but rumours, rumours that are yet to be confirmed."

 GUZ_Yang_Ruxuan_for_desc: "When Yang Ruxuan returned to Kunming, he was no longer a follower of Zhu Peide. After the fall of Chongqing, seeing all hopes are lost, he is amongst the first batch of officers to surrender, and as a perk, were given extraordinary payment and status by the Japanese. Thus General Yang remained, staying in the General Staff of the Nanjing Regime. Since the Second Yun-Gui War, he has been dispatched by the Central Government to Kunming, taking part in the Japan-mediated peace talks, and was eventually left in Kunming to oversee many things here in the Southwest, as a liaison. In addition, he was also awarded many merely ceremonious roles, such as the Commandant of the Anti-Air forces. As it is part of his duty, he often excuses himself from the messy political scene and makes for the airports, where he spends hours each day, staring into the old landing strips, lost in thoughts."
 GUZ_Miao_Yuntai_eco_desc: "A well-known industrialist, Miao Yuntai found the New Fudian Bank and for a long while had an almost complete monopoly of the Southwestern economy, even before he participated in the political scene. Years after Zhou Fohai purposely ruined his master project of transforming Yunnan, Miao Yuntai is now once more taking up the mantle of rejuvenating Yunnan and the entire Southwest. However, this time, rather than brilliant economic investments and austerities, Miao was forced to take a far more sinister path. Seeing Yunnan would otherwise fall into complete anarchy, Miao opted for more unconventional methods of acquiring funds and keeping the Three Provinces running. Since 1952, with the unofficial approval of Miao, the Yunnanese Army started production of opium, and its monopoly through rifles worked great to benefit the army and Miao Family. Now, Miao Yuntai has ascended to become the third most powerful player in the Southwest. What this 'Patriotic Capitalist' thinks of himself are not certain, but hatred towards him is well heard in every corner of the Southwest."

 GUZ_Lu_Han_sec_desc: "Lu Han has always been one of the closest companions of Chairman Long Yun and has always been the Second-in-Charge of the New Dian Clique essentially since its birth. Since He was expelled, the military affairs of Yunnan are now his alone to bear. As an old friend of Long, he is well aware of Long's great anguish, seeing how Yunnan, the Southwest, and the whole of China have become. As he ages, Long, ever more dull and senile, chose to bar himself from daily routines, and have grown numb. Every day, while taking over some of Long's work, he would pass by Long Yun's garden en route to picking up documents to look over and sign. And there he would see the old Marshal Long, sitting on a simple bench beneath a statue of him. His eyes idle and his thoughts far, all while his son ceaselessly bombards him with plans after plans, all of which unsettling to Lu. Lu Han knows when the day comes, he will be as immovable as his friendship with Chairman Long.\n\nHe must save Yunnan, and Long Yun."
