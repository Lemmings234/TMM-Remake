 RUS_2WRWKazakhstan.1.t:0 "The Akmolinsk Conference"
 RUS_2WRWKazakhstan.1.desc:0 "Now that we have chosen to reorganize the Kazakh state, we will have to make serious decisions as to its future. Most dramatic is that of the Polish exiles that formed the government of the former 'Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Nowa Polska'.\n\nWhile the Soviets were admirable in their sheltering of many Poles, who'd certainly be doomed to enslavement or extermination otherwise - their methods were clumsy as per usual. The region of Nowa Polska, which constituted the regions of Oral and Atyrau, was practically colonized by Polish exiles, who now clamor for us to allow them to re-establish some form of degenerated 'Nowa Polska', independent of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Poles, for their part, promise to allow Kazakhs freedom of movement to and from Kazakhstan, along with rights and protections to the Kazakh people, including to vote in promised legislative elections to their 'Sejm'. They also promise to cede the land back to Kazakhstan once Warsaw is liberated. We are sympathetic to their cause, especially when they recount the horrors of family lost, of the terror of not having their own home.\n\nWhile all of this sounds nice, we should be realistic on how unlikely Warsaw coming under Polish control is, as sad as it may be. We also need to account for the wishes of the Kazakh people, who have argued that continued Polish occupation of these regions could become permanent, creating an underclass of Kazakhs in their own land. The Kazakh government promises that they will treat Poles as a respected minority, like any other minority group that may arrive due to immigration. Finally, they've reminded our government of the domineering attitude Russia has had towards their people. They are not particularly interested in having a foreign government carve up their land once more.\n\nAs much as we'd like to imagine that there's a perfect solution, the previous administration's decisions, along with the fraught history and politics of these peoples means that one side will be left unhappy. What will we do, Mr. President?"
 RUS_2WRWKazakhstan.1.a:0 "Allow the exiles to reestablish Nowa Polska."
 RUS_2WRWKazakhstan.1.b:0 "All of Kazakhstan will be united under a Kazakh government."
