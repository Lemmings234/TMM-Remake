 NOV_meet_with_pokryshkin_desc:0 "The President has called Pokryshkin and all military leaders across the Federation to return to Novosibirsk and convene in the war room to plan the Federation's strategy in the upcoming war against the German Reich. Here, we will not only review our drafted plan of attack, but also figure out what logistical preparations the All-Russian Army needs to make before we can begin the liberation of Eastern Europe from Nazi tyranny."
 
 NOV_send_in_the_spies:0 "Send in the Sluzhba Bezopasnosti"
 NOV_send_in_the_spies_desc:0 "Pokryshkin has made it clear to the President that if we are to liberate our sacred Moscow from the Nazi occupiers and repel them from our lands, the first course of action would be to send in agents of the Sluzhba Bezopasnosti behind enemy lines to gather intelligence and weaken [MCW.GetNameDef] from within.\n\nNot only will we gather information, but we can begin to lay the groundwork for potential revolts behind the enemy's frontlines. We too, can learn from our communist forbears."

 NOV_weaken_their_administration_desc:0 "[MCW.GetNameDefCap]'s hold on their territory is tenuous at best, often battling partisans and rebels across the nation, primarily near our border. With the right men shot dead by our agents and certain individuals going missing, their weak administration will rapidly turn to skeletal, breaking any illusion of control they think they have over the occupied lands of Western Russia. When the time is right, we will use this to our advantage."
 
 NOV_sabotage_factories:0 "Sabotage Their Factories"
 NOV_sabotage_factories_desc:0 "To defeat a nation swiftly, it is imperative that we knock out their industrial capabilities as quickly as possible. Annihilating their industrial capacity will hinder their efforts to resupply their armies and allow us to use our relative material superiority to crush their troops beneath the boot of the advancing All-Russian Army."
 
 NOV_break_their_encryption:0 "Break Their Encryption"
 NOV_break_their_encryption_desc:0 "Cracking the [MCW.GetAdjective] encryptions will grant the All-Russian Army unlimited access to all Nazi supply lines, battle tactics and troop movements across the Moscow area, giving us superior intelligence over out enemy in the coming conflict against the [GER.GetFactionName]."

 NOV_they_are_broken_desc:0 "The Sluzhba Bezopasnosti's final target are the officer corps of the [MCW.GetAdjective]. Wiping out their most experienced and most innovative military staff will cripple their ability to effectively fight our troops on the field and completely demoralize their pitiful axillaries, and hopefully break their will to fight the advancing All-Russian Army."
 
 NOV_prepare_western_defences:0 "Prepare Western Defences"
 NOV_prepare_western_defences_desc:0 "Marshal Novikov has made it clear that it would be foolish to not prepare any defenses for the war ahead. Our western border is vulnerable to a German counteroffensive, lacking the necessary fortifications to halt a potential advance into our lands in their tracks. We must begin mobilizing the nation and prepare for the unfortunate but very real possibility that the war will not go so smoothly."

 NOV_build_up_airbases_desc:0 "It won't matter how many MIG-23's and YAK-28PP's the Federation has produced to face the Luftwaffe in the skies if we lack the airfields required to field our vast fleet. Pokryshkin is recommended we expand the existing airfields in Russia as quickly as possible.\n\n"If we lose the war in the air, we lose the war and we lose it quickly." - Bernard L. Montgomery"

 NOV_watch_the_barents_sea_desc:0 "As we make our defensive preparations for the coming war with Germany, our advisors have pointed out one of the Federation's great weaknesses.\n\nThe Barents Sea.\n\nThe Germans will undoubtedly have naval superiority throughout the war and may use this advantage to exploit our northern weaknesses to breach our coastline. We must take necessary measures to reinforce Northern Russia and ensure that the Germans make it no further than the cold shores of Arkhangelsk."
 
 NOV_lessons_of_barbarossa:0 "Lessons from Barbarossa"
 NOV_lessons_of_barbarossa_desc:0 "We have learned from the mistakes that were made during Operation Barbarossa. The Wehrmacht has not changed since the West Russian War, we know what to expect and more importantly, how to stop them in their tracks.

 NOV_condemn_the_reich:0 "Condemn the Reich"
 NOV_condemn_the_reich_desc:0 "It is time for the Federation to speak directly to the Reich and to the world at large. The people of the world must never forget the unforgivable crimes the German Reich has inflicted upon the Russian people and the peoples of Europe for forty long years. We will publicly condemn the Reich in an open letter, and let them, and all of the world, know that Russia fights for freedom and human decency against the forces of evil."
 
 NOV_mobilise_the_federation:0 "Mobilize the Federation"
 NOV_mobilise_the_federation_desc:0 "To defeat the Nazi menace, we must complete the Federation's transition to a war economy. Key industrial sectors will be temporarily nationalized and all production reorganized for the conflict against the German superpower. The entire Russian economy will be transformed from simple tools and products to weapons of total warfare which will be necessary to liberate the Muscovite people from the chains of oppression."
 
 NOV_a_blitzkrieg_of_our_own:0 "A Blitzkrieg of our Own"
 NOV_a_blitzkrieg_of_our_own_desc:0 "When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, they overwhelmed the unprepared Red Army with their mass assault of tanks, planes and mechanized divisions, using the Blitzkrieg to overwhelm Belarus and Ukraine and seize our sacred Moscow.\n\nThey caught us off-guard.\n\nBut not this time.\n\nThis time, it will be the All-Russian Army that overruns the Wehrmacht with such speed and ferocity that we will have the Wehrmacht fleeing west in the same panic and fear that the Russian Army had once felt." 
 
 NOV_invade_the_reich:0 "For the Liberation of All Russians!"
 NOV_invade_the_reich_desc:0 "After years of suffering and humiliation at the hands of the German Reich, the Federation is ready to step westward and liberate the occupied lands under the domination of this imperialist state.

We risk everything we hold dear to our hearts in this coming conflict. Let us battle our old foe one last time and give them a fight they'll never forget."

 NOV_to_liberate_russia_desc:0 "The finest war machines blaze into German holdings, ready to liberate Moscow. In airfields all around West Russia, plane after plane takes off, ready to sacrifice their lives to defend the brave ones fighting the menace on foot. In Arkhangelsk, the Russian Fleet sets sail, getting ready to defend our hard won Arctic holdings. Millions march with strict precision, rifles aimed forward, killing all who stand in our way.\n\nOf course, every tank needs its fuel, and all armies need soldiers. This is why ramping up conscription is the only option if we want to keep enough men in the ranks of our already massive army. More able bodied men shall serve, and the All-Russian Army will grow even stronger!\n\nOnwards!"
 
 NOV_brave_sons_of_russia:0 "Brave Sons of Russia"
 NOV_brave_sons_of_russia_desc:0 "Although the All-Russian Army is mighty enough as it is, we mustn't forget that the Wehrmacht outnumber us. Thus, the only way to counter the vast armies of the Nazi Reich is to conscript more brave young men into the ranks of the All-Russian Army.\n\nFor every brave son of our Motherland they knock down, those bastards will only discover a hundred more vengeful men waiting for them with their rifles fixated between their eyes!"

 NOV_plead_to_europe_desc:0 "Brothers and Sisters of Europe, the struggle for the liberation of our sacred continent is at hand. As the All-Russian Army bravely marches westward to face the Wehrmacht, we call upon all free peoples of Europe to support our great struggle against the Reich by any means they can.\n\nOnly when Free Europe is united together as one can we free our continent from Nazi repression and ensure that the future of this ancient land will one of freedom and prosperity, not only for our children but for generations to come."
 
 NOV_spread_war_propaganda:0 "Rally the People"
 NOV_spread_war_propaganda_desc:0 "We must remind our population what who we are fighting for.\n\nWe fight for the Muscovites who have been displaced from their homes to make way for settlers, who are being treated as subhumans in their own land.\n\nWe fight for the Caucasians, who have long endured segregation and oppression at the hands of the Reich which seeks to turn their beautiful land into one large oil field.\n\nWe fight for the Ukrainians, whose lands have been reduced to nothing more than farmland for the Reich.\n\nWe fight for the natives of Belarus and the Baltics, who watch on helplessly as their homelands are colonized by their oppressors.\n\nWe fight for the liberation of Eastern Europe, no matter the cost!"

 NOV_onwards_to_moscow_desc:0 "Comrades!\n\nOur progress to liberate Russia has gone swiftly and decisively, and the oil wells of Caucasia and the sacred cities of Saint Petersburg and Moscow have been rightfully returned to us.\n\nHowever, now is not the time to slow down and consolidate our position. Rather, we shall do the opposite! The time is ripe for a brand new offensive, one that will tear apart what's left of the Wehrmacht and liberate what still remains in the Germans' grimy hands.\n\n§RIt's time for… Operation Bagration.§!"
 
 NOV_recruit_the_slaves:0 "Work with the Russian Partisans"
 NOV_recruit_the_slaves_desc:0 "Throughout the war, the partisan forces deep within the occupied lands of the Reich have hindered the German war machine at every turn.

 NOV_remember_whats_at_stake_desc:0 ""Some of our generals are worried about possible German counterattacks.\n\nI say, let them come!\n\nOur forces do not fear the Wehrmacht! The average German soldier, slow and weak without his metal shield, is no match for the mighty All-Russian Army! Wherever they attempt to attack, they shall be met with a shower of lead, rained down by line after line of patriotic young Russian men, arms at the ready, all willing to lay their lives down for the good of Russia and all of the peoples of Europe!\n\nThe All-Russian Army shall march onwards, unrelenting!" - Alexander Pokryshkin"
 
 NOV_deal_with_america:0 "Call upon the OFN"
 NOV_deal_with_america_desc:0 "The OFN is our natural ally in our struggle against the Reich. However, asking them to get involved directly in the conflict would be asking too much and only push the globe closer to nuclear annihilation. Still, there is much they could do to assist us in our struggle against Germany, such as selling us their weapons and mobilizing volunteer divisions from America, Canada and Australia to join the frontlines and aid in the fight against the fascist menace!"
 
 NOV_invade_the_reich:0 "For the Liberation of All Russians!"
 NOV_invade_the_reich_desc:0 "People of the Russian Federation, our victory draws nearer! The Wehrmacht crumbles before the unstoppable might of the All-Russian Army!

 NOV_expand_intelligence_presence_desc:0 "The Sluzhba Bezopasnosti has for years been the silent and deadly hand of the Federation.

Through the strength of our airforce, we have been able to triumph over our enemies from Moscow to Magadan.\n\nNow that the Luftwaffe has been beaten and repelled from the skies of Russia, we can now turn our air capabilities against the partisans.

Decades of German mismanagement and the atrocities the Wehrmacht committed against the innocent people of Eastern Europe throughout the war have devastated the population.\n\nThe Federation must be swift in aiding our western brothers and sisters through this difficult time in our history by providing emergency shelter and food.

So many beautiful sights that once upon a time, were a testament to our strength, ingenuity, and intelligence as a nation.\n\nNow they lie in ruin, left to rot or made into practice targets by the Wehrmacht. Centuries of Russian achievements, destroyed or bastardized into 'Germanic' eyesores. The Kremlin, the heart of Moscow, turned into a mere military base for the Wehrmacht. This is unacceptable. We need to restore our lost history as quickly as possible, no matter the cost.\n\nTheir value to our people, the lessons they leave, no matter how dark some may be, are invaluable in ensuring that the mistakes of the past are never repeated."

Many construction projects are taking many more weeks to complete without the more modern tools the workers of the Russian Federation currently enjoy.\n\nIf we which to rebuild the administrative heart of Muscovy as swiftly as possible, it would be pertinent to support their reconstruction efforts and send some of the Federations construction equipment to the West Russian Reconstruction Zone."

Government decades have been translated and disseminated in Russia, giving us the administrative capacity to operate the first local elections in the Moscow area - just in time. The people clamor for our Federation's promises to be made whole, as our soldiers report citizens asking for when they will be able to vote for their leaders.\n\nFor decades, the Muscovites had been deprived of choice in their own land. They could not elect anyone to represent them in any form of government, forced to be mere oppressed subjects.\n\nTheir enthusiasm for democracy is promising and shows the Federation that Western Russia is becoming more and more ready to rejoin the Motherland and embrace its values of liberty and democracy."

 NOV_rebuild_western_cities_desc:0 "As the All-Russian Army marched westwards, many Muscovite cities were turned into battlefields, fought over between our brave sons and the Wehrmacht's dogs.\n\nAs a result, most of these cities were damaged, with many Muscovites losing their homes in the fighting. While our emergency aid was able provide temporary shelter, it was meager living, mainly tents and military rations. We cannot rebuild a nation on such barebones conditions, and we cannot stand idly by while our historic lands suffer.\n\nWe will begin reconstruction efforts in earnest, rebuilding our cities brick by brick with legions of workers from the Federation's interior and soldiers stationed in the Moscow area.

 NOV_support_rural_muscovites_desc:0 "For decades, Muscovy has been seen by the world as the backwater of Europe, a poor rural subject of the Reich, good for its slave labor and nothing more. Any progress made in urbanizing and industrializing these lands was quickly undone during our advance into 'Mosckowien'.\n\nWith Muscovy firmly under our control, our first step should be to re-industrialize these lands as soon as possible, starting with modernizing the agricultural industries of the west, lifting the peasants out of poverty and bringing the region up to par with the rest of the Federation as fast as possible. With this, many peasants will be unneeded, and may move to the cities, giving us a large workforce for a nascent industrial base."

 NOV_create_new_oppertunities_desc:0 "Whilst the modernization of agriculture in Muscovy is a great first step in developing these broken lands, it will be through the powerful fist of industrialization that we will transform this Eastern European backwater into the economic and industrial heart of the Russian Federation.\n\nAlready, several Russian companies have requested to build new factories in these lands, now ripe with opportunity. Many of the ruined factories that had existed during the days of the old union can be easily rebuilt within weeks and offer jobs to millions of Muscovites who were left jobless following the war, along with the former peasants who, now being redundant in their family farm's daily operations, will seek new opportunities to make money.\n\nThe people of Muscovy require jobs and opportunity to accelerate its economic development and the Russian Federation shall deliver."

 NOV_reintroduce_russian_desc:0 "For decades, the Muscovites have been forced to learn and speak the language of their former oppressors. The result of this is a clear language barrier that has created a large divide between Muscovy and the Russian Federation. While the older folk know how to speak, and many read, fluent Russian, the youth are illiterate. Though the Russian language was kept as a sort of thieves cant, the inability to write in Cyrillic is extremely troublesome.\n\nWe do not expect to overcome this large language barrier any time soon, but by formally reintroducing Russian as the official language of the region, we can slowly begin to heal the cultural and linguistic damage done by the Germans."

Hailing from the vast plains of Siberia, the Federation has reunited all of Russia and successfully liberated the peoples of Eastern Europe from its servitude to their former masters.\n\nWith the map of Eastern Europe redrawn, we can now step forth and move our attention beyond Russia, towards Eastern Europe proper.

We have come with a promise of liberty, and plan to redefine our relationship with Ukraine. We are not new colonial masters, but friends of the peoples of Ukraine.\n\nWe do not expect to win over the hearts and minds of every Ukrainian through mere words. Actions speak louder then words, and helping them rebuild their cities and townships is a great place to start. With Russians and Ukrainians working side by side to rebuild the lands of Ukraine, new bonds of brotherhood can be established between our two peoples.\n\nA bond not easily broken."

 NOV_the_ukrainian_language_desc:0 "Much like in Western Russia, Ukrainians endured the attempted Germanization of their nation at the hands of the Reich.\n\nOwing to its more western location, entire areas of the region have been dominated by German settlers, most notably the Crimean Peninsula. Our work to educate our Ukrainian brethren on their own language will require much more work than our previous efforts in Muscovy, but we must persevere.

 NOV_to_the_history_books_desc:0 "Under the rule of the Reich, Ukraine was a land of many contrasts. Many groups from the German government, the Ukrainian collaborators, to the reformist industrialists, all vied for power and influence over the former Reichskommisariat. Their squabbling came at the expense of all, even the settlers, as Ukraine was left as a one-commodity nation, fully dependent on agriculture.\n\nThe legacy of the decades of political conflict still has an affect of the Ukrainian psyche and economy.

However, we'll need someone to rally the people behind, once we approach the final stages.\n\n§RLuckily, we have just the man for the job.§!"

 NOV_remnants_of_armenia_desc:0 "Once part of the Russian Empire and later, the Soviet Union, Armenia has endured the reign of terror spearheaded by the Grey Wolves of Turkey. Even after their attempted genocide of the Armenian people after the First World War, the Fifth Inspectorate General deported millions of Armenians to the arid Levant and caused a great revolt that was quelled in rivers of bloodshed.\n\nAlthough the Turks have failed in the past, if nothing is done to save the Armenian people from Turkish oppression, the Grey Wolves may one day successfully exterminate the peoples of Armenia.\n\nThis is unacceptable, we will not stand by this obvious genocide! The Federation cannot stand by and watch as what was done to our people is done to the Armenians. We must do what we can to liberate the Armenians from Turkish oppression and ensure that the ancient identity and culture of Armenia survives."

 NOV_send_in_russias_monster_desc:0 "We have several intelligence operatives deeply embedded in [TUR.GetNameDef]. With their help, we can gain insights into the state, their armies, their weaknesses, and so on. More importantly, we can link up with the remaining partisans and freedom fighters. We will not be working with ultranationalists or their like, but our recent successes have created a lot of opportunities for helping build up a democratic movement for the liberation of Armenia. This movement will be far more successful in winning over undecided people who are more moderate, along with even some Turkish people in the area, if we promise they'll be treated humanely under a new administration.\n\nBy gaining the upper hand in information and in the war of words, we can neutralize the advantages the Turks would normally have, and lay the groundwork for one more Armenian revolt."

 NOV_fund_the_rebels_desc:0 "Much like the partisans of Croatia, the remaining Armenian rebels have survived in the mountains. However, their strength and numbers are faltering as the Armenian people begin to lose faith in resistance, consigned to fleeing or being the last of their kind. Luckily for the rebels, they have the vast resources of the Russian Federation now available to them - provided they abide by certain standards.\n\nWith the Armenians committed to democracy fully equipped with the best equipment we can offer, they can turn the tide and beat back the Turkish forces, bringing new hope for the noble cause of Armenian liberation from Turkish tyranny."

 NOV_the_armenian_revolution_desc:0 "With our generous funding, our intelligence agents, and our careful oversight, the Armenian rebel forces are quickly growing stronger. With Turkey more isolated than ever before, the Armenian leadership have approached our government, requesting the Federation support them in a full scale democratic revolution against the Turkish government. With the Reich still in shambles, now would be the best time to strike what remains of the Turkish empire and free the Armenian people.\n\n§YLet the revolution begin!§!"

 NOV_reunification.1.desc:0 "President Shukshin stood before a vast crowd of supporters who had gathered from as far as Arkhangelsk to hear their President speak. Long gone was the nervousness in his voice from when he had fought for democracy in Novosibirsk, he had grown into his role as Russia's champion of democracy - and hopefully, their liberator.\n\n"Russia is one!" the President proclaimed.\n\nImmediately, the crowd erupted in cheers of celebration. It was almost hard to believe it. A people, once so submissive and broken in an age of warlordism, now proud and hopeful of the days ahead. It proved a belief that Shukshin held: people could not be truly defeated. Their humiliation was temporary, bound to return with great energy!\n\nShukshin let them continue their cheering until they fell back into silence as the President spoke again.\n\n"However, not all Russians are with us this day. Millions of our people beyond our borders still live under occupation. Their rights as human beings striped from them, reduced to second class citizens in their own land. To those people unfortunate enough to live under such conditions, hear me when I say this".\n\nShukshin paused for a moment, a proud smirk emerging on his face as he gazed upon the crowds of thousands before him, watching him in silence - as was the rest of the world.\n\n"Your liberation is coming!".\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly as Shukshin looked toward the skies, basking in the sunlight and the cool air. He felt it, the winds of change in the afternoon breeze. Things were different now and the doubting world would have it proven to them."

Having fought in the Smuta already, he understood the commodity that was peace. Shoot - after Tomsk, he finally settled down. His wife's small bookshop was doing great once they weren't getting raided by Pokryshkin's goons for 'peddling syndicalist propaganda'.\n\nVladimir hailed a trolley lady walking buy to purchase a sandwich, one with imported vegetables from Mexico. How far they'd come, he wondered while idly staring out at the endless taiga flying by. When Shukshin proclaimed the Federation, how everyone had cheered!\n\nYes, Vladimir had been content to live in their smaller Russia, but the clarion call to free their shackled brethren over the radio has woken him up from his stupor. One more war, for his people, for liberation, for the democracy he enjoyed. He'd always been a selfless person, fighting bullies at the schoolyard, joining Shukshin's movement when it was nigh-illegal to do so. Now, that same man had called on all brave sons of Russia to liberate their homeland."

Still, Vladimir had fought for peace in Russia, to protect its people from chaos and anarchy. Was it really any surprise that he'd join one last war to protect those who were enslaved, who the Germans attempted to exterminate? Her wife had protested, had pleaded with him, but resolutely, despite even her dearest Anya's tears, Vladimir did not budge. He was going to sign up for one more tour in the All-Russian Army. Still, Anya had made him solemnly swear to write, a request which had no issue with. In addition, she had given him a letter and told him to open it when he left the station, but he had forgotten to do so. He withdrew the letter from his jacket pocket and broke the wax seal.\n\n"...I will pray for your safety, dearest, and your protection. And I wanted to tell you something to give you hope, to give you strength, I would have told you on that day, but I knew it would keep you by me, and you would have regretted it for the rest of your life. I urge you to continue your journey. Our second son's name shall be Alexander."\n\nVladimir gritted his teeth as the train finally stopped. He stood up and looked toward the west, a look of determination in his eyes. He had another son on the way, one that he could not allow to grow up without a father. He needed to get home but before he could do that, there was something he had to do. For the good of his family and his country."

It seemed to correspond with his current position as the President of the Federation. He had the Siloviks in his left ear and the corporations in his right. All day, 24/7. Vasily didn't like the job. As a matter of fact, he despised it. At times, he wished he was back in Barnaul, challenging Pokryshkin and backing minor reforms. To Shukshin, that was much easier to deal with than his current situation.\n\nDespite his recent efforts, there was still much to do. Hell, there was an entire system that needed to be overhauled and reformed if the Federation was to ever become a truly free and democratic nation. The Siloviks were putting up stiff resistance at every turn, doing everything possible to halt the reforms and to overrule the newly founded Federal Assembly.\n\nFor decades, since breaking away from the failed Central Siberian Republic, the Siloviks under Pokryshkin had been in power. They made the Federation what it was. A land where the 'strongmen' had complete rule of the people, pocketing the cash and ignoring the damage they had done in the name of stability and prosperity. His Federation would be different, however. It wouldn't be like the misplaced idealism of the failed CSR and It wouldn't be like Pokryshkin's cynical Federation.

A city built by Russian hands, populated by Russians, stolen by the Japanese Empire at gunpoint. Could he do it? Could he pull off a negotiation with a superpower? His popularity would skyrocket if they could retake their Far Eastern lands, but if he were to fail in this endeavor… The increasingly anxious President ran a hand through his hair, sifting through the possibilities in his head.\n\nRight on cue, Pokryshkin entered his office. Acknowledging the Ace's presence with a nod, the Writer gestured to the empty seat for Pokryshkin to take. "You know why I called you here, Alexander. We can't ignore Vladivostok".\n\n The Falcon nodded, placing several files down on Vasily's desk. "I've spoken with some of my colleagues, and we've come up with several proposals to deal with the Japanese." Shukshin took one of the folders and opened it. "Most of our solutions involve a Japanese leaning economic treaty that would last for the next couple of years. We could allow their Zaibatsus to set up shop in Chita and Magadan for resources; we'd can get investments from them to help develop the Far East, in addition to reclaiming Vladivostok. Alternatively, we could offer them support through the current oil crisis."\n\nThe Falcon grinned, pointing to the second folder. "This one gives them a deal they literally can't reject.

His life had been constant suffering; he lost his father in Moscow, his mother and little brother had succumbed to hunger while his sister had been worked to death in factories of Perm, making bullets for those Nazi-loving bastards, and all the while he barely stayed alive by living off the wilderness. West Russia was eventually unified, and some sort of benefits came from that - but he still worked in a factory, still struggled to survive. When [WSR.GetNameDef] was defeated by the Siberian Federation, Nikolai was similarly pessimistic. A rule by corporations and their strongmen Siloviki, hah! Just one more despot in a long line of others.\n\nBut President Shukshin was different. The corporations were still terrible, he was still being paid meagerly, but things got a little better - he was able to purchase more things, the paid got slightly higher, and he saw someone in the newspaper being arrested for corruption. Nikolai knew Shukshin wasn't an angel - the Siloviki still had too much power, in his eyes, but he saw in Shukshin a man who gave a damn, who actually cared about the common person - and not in the way the hypocritical communists did, who preached about the proletarian revolution while working you to death. He was an improvement, and that alone felt positive to Nikolai. But the thing that truly made him wonder if things could get better, the thing that tore into his doubt, was when President Shukshin announced that there would be regular elections, and that all people could vote, not just the rich. For once, he felt like something good might come out of living in a nation called Russia, as a person known as Russian. For once, he could dream of a better life."

With reforms to our industry and our military, we'll be more than ready to retake Vladivostok and Moscow - despite what the American pundits say." The Falcon stared at the writer, clearly unconvinced.\n\nVasily sighed, and looked out the window.  "The people are getting restless." Shukshin took an uneasy breath.

A testament to the strength of the new Russia he was steering out of darkness and into prosperity.\n\n"Mr President," a voice called, snapping him out of his thoughts. He turned to face one of his bodyguards. "It's almost time for your speech." Shukshin nodded, hastily following his men to his quarters by the stage. After quickly rehearsing his speech to himself, he left his quarters. Waiting outside was none other than his old rival, the Siberian Falcon himself.\n\n"How was the train?" The President inquired curiously. "They're of high quality," Pokryshkin mused, "I didn't expect such fine work managed by a simpleton like you." Shukshin grinned. "Made without corporate ass-kissing, mind you." The older man groaned. Before he could burst into another one of his rants on ‘stability', Shukshin had walked away, heading toward the stage. Pokryshkin sighed with amusement. How were they even friends?\n\nThe President of the Russian Federation appeared on stage accompanied by thunderous applause. Waving to the crowd, he shook the hands of the CEOs of Feniks, Sibir and Titan, ignoring their bitter looks before picking up the nearby microphone. "Today, we are gathered here to not only reopen the Trans-Siberian railway but also to celebrate how far we have come as a nation!" The crowd roared in approval as the their President made promises of freedom and prosperity for all Russians before finally reaching his conclusion.

A President was expected to inspect his army, to take on the mantle as commander in chief, but he did not truly understand what to look for, what to see in these brave soldiers who fought for Russia. However, even an untrained eye like his could stare at the Russian-made rifles and think about how they compared to the German modern equipment, how they paled in comparison to the Luftwaffe's newest jets, or how their tanks would shred like paper when hit by the newest Panzer model.\n\nOnce the inspection ended, Shukshin nudged Marshal Novikov for a discussion at his office. Shukshin smiled, disarming his look of concern, "Relax, Marshal, I'm not here to castigate you. The thing I've learned over the years is not to presume I know everything, to be humble. I wanted to ask you something: how will our kit face up to those German Nazis?"\n\nNovikov looked out the window with weathered concern creasing his brow. "You won't like the answer. Money. We need money to research new technology, and even more money to procure said new technology. Otherwise, German heavy tanks will prevent us from moving at all, we'll be almost completely unable to stop them."\n\nShukshin look at him in concern, "Is it that bad. Marshal?"\n\n"It's bad. Instability in the Reich might make their forces weaker than they'd be otherwise, but we need to prepare, we need more money for procurement, there's no getting around that."\n\nAs Shukshin left to meet with his ministers, it became painfully clear just how much would need to be done in order to prepare his army for war.

The newest batch of Russian-made tanks rumbles past, their armor shining under the sun. Uncountable amounts of artillery hug the sides of the men that haul them along as a cavalry division trots by, holding their bayonets up to the sky.\n\nShukshin gazed upon the never-ending lines of soldiers from the balcony and felt a few emotions tug at his heartstrings. Pride. Pride to the new Federation he had built, now a beacon of hope in this godforsaken world. A bit of confidence, maybe? This parade was barely a fraction of the Federation's actual army, which had become a force capable of standing up to the armies of Germany and Japan. But above all of these emotions, uncertainty. Uncertainty about the future. Would the negotiations with Japan fail? Could they beat back the Germans? What if they couldn't liberate Moscow? What if they lo-?\n\nShukshin was snapped out of his thoughts by a firm hand on his back.

A decade ago, the average Russian would have already been considered lucky if they had been under one of the more merciful, idealistic warlord states, but now the standard of living for the average Russian had risen steadily since reunification.

The sun was shining; wind blew gently through jade leaves; children were playing football in the street, their lessons completed or escaped. It was not the sort of day to condemn a man.\n\n"The Federation will be a nation of laws," Shukshin said. "I can't let you go free of my own volition. The Presidency must always be subject to Russian law, not above it as the Bolsheviks once were. You'll have your day in court."\n\nBukharin nodded. "I understand."\n\nBut even then, Shukshin knew that the ex-Premier would never have justice. The Russian people knew he was guilty, even if that wasn't true. They would judge him, and an old man who'd already punished himself would rot in a cell for the rest of his short and sickly life. Was that to be his legacy? Turning Bukharin over to mob justice? Letting his people slake their thirst for revenge? Or would he give special treatment to a tyrant, the author of anarchy, the monster who'd condemned men no different than Shukshin to the gulags?\n\nWould he break the law he'd authored for the sake of mercy?"

The Federation has asked our administration to support their claims in the region in order to gain diplomatic leverage over the Japanese Empire.\n\nThe Federation regaining their Pacific territories would work well in weakening the Japanese in the Pacific as well as bolstering a Russian counterweight in the region, but some in our government do not wish to worsen relations with the Japanese any further.

As such, the residents near the base, spread out throughout the villages in western Tomsk Oblast, were abuzz in rumors when a helicopter flew overhead. Their rumors might have actually been correct in scandal and scope, as none other than President Shukshin walked out of that helicopter, on that fateful day.\n\n"Mister President, we're glad you've arrived," remarked one smartly dressed scientist. Next to the scientist was a military officer, complete in his dress uniform, "If you would please follow us, sir."\n\nVasily followed the men into the base's interior. What seemed like a humble military base led into an elevator that took them deep into the ground. Outside of the elevator was a lab that required both the military man and the scientist to simultaneously insert a key into two locks on either side of the door. Beyond that door was something that shook Shukshin to his core: a large silo, holding a missile on the inside. Although the President had been informed on the progress of the Russian nuclear program, to see the weapon himself gave him equal measures of both awe and horror.\n\nThe officer began to speak.

You have all been given instructions - clear instructions - to present your case for our general strategy for this war. Please, I want a clear and concise explanation of your strategy, and be honest about its potential downsides.

"Mister President, with all due respect, I cannot endorse this type of strategy. This is the same foolish thinking the Revolutionary Front had, that a quick victory would be assured. History shows us that the Germans are tenacious, and are willing to go on counteroffensives with carefully crafted fascist partisans to fight us. We should not be so arrogant as to believe we will wipe out a world power in one fell swoop. I instead propose a careful strategy of slow advancement, with plenty of fallback lines in case their armored divisions begin tearing through our troops."\n\nMuch bickering ensued, only to be thankfully ended when Shukshin raised a hand.\n\n"Let's combine the two," he said.

Bukharin didn't know if Shukshin would lead Russia to health, but perhaps anything was better than his leadership.\n\nA knock could be heard from the cell door. Bukharin looked up to see President Shukshin standing there. Bukharin got up out of respect, "Mr. President?"\n\nShukshin looked around, as if checking for someone, before speaking up. "Nikolai Bukharin, you are hereby leaving this cell," Bukharin's eyes lit up - they were going to execute him - "Under house arrest, with medical supervision due to your old age." Shukshin explained. Bukharin paused for a moment as his panic grew into shock. "... You'd just let me go? Just like that?" Shukshin nodded. "You don't deserve to be free, Bukharin. Not after what you've done, after you ran away from your people, but I don't believe an old man should die in a cell. You deserve to be with your family, at least."\n\nAt that, he stepped back to reveal Svetlana Bukharina, who walked in with a soft smile on her face. "My Svetlana!" Bukharin exclaimed, tears beginning to form in his eyes. Bukharina nodded, tears running down her cheeks before running toward her father, jumping into his arms. "Oh, I was so worried when you left me," Bukharin mumbled as he held onto his only surviving family. "I'm here now, Father. Just rest, it'll be okay." Bukharina said. Nikolai glanced at a smiling Shukshin, giving him a curt nod with admiration in his eyes as he held onto his daughter. Taking in that look of grace, of gratefulness for a mercy both knew Bukharin did not deserve, Shukshin left the two to their comfort, and into the crowds that'd be full of hatred for these two souls.\n\nThis was the right decision, despite the people's frustration.

Next thing you know, you're going to tell me they're banning corporate entities from donating to campaigns!" he bellowed.

This makes things harder," he began. For a moment, he put his head in his hands, muttering about how "Holding's gonna get my ass... who the hell didn't talk to Shukshin to calm him down..." But after considering the situation for a while, he smirked, "Hard, but not impossible. Georgy! Start typing for me." His assistant dutifully rushed to his typewriter.\n\nThe reality was that the restrictions limited corporate influence, but surely did not end it. "We've got their asses on the media, and we can donate as individuals, can't we? You get that, Georgy?" Georgy nodded after a ding rang on the typewriter, followed by the sound of moving parts as he set the typewriter to its next line. "Anything else, sir? I can send this memo out tomorrow, I think."\n\n"Well... you can go home, kid. I might just crank out a few more ideas on the page. These son-of-a-bitches think they can stop us from guiding Russia into prosperity, but we'll drag'em kicking and screaming into the modern age if we have to.

Oh yes, the RAPP may have struck a blow to the corporations, but they did not win the war. One good election, maybe getting that old chap Primakov in, and they'd retake Russia and never let it go.

Dimitri explained, finally lowering his hands.\n\n"President Shukshin? He's so fixated on Moscow these days, didn't think the guy cared about us here in Manchuria," Pyotr wondered aloud.\n\nHe turned away from Dimitri, thinking to himself for a moment. When Russia shattered, the NAJUA and other Russian partisans had been left to fend for themselves before the Kwantung Army finally broke them in Khabarovsk. Now the President of his homeland reunited wants him to jump into the fray. But it wasn't so easy. The people were complacent after so long, the cells tiny and defeated. Pyotr lost many of his brothers and sisters in arms in their impossible mission to free the Amur basin from Japanese rule and it amounted to nothing. But that was without a strong Russia to support them. Perhaps, this time, there would finally be a chance of success. Maybe there is a chance that he could fulfill his mission: to liberate his fellow Russians. Pyotr sighed as he turned around to face Dimitri."

No one dared to move, no one brought drinks, the most anyone brought was a notebook, and he was an exception. Already Nikolaev was feeling the sweat, the drop of water making the slow climb down his face. Suddenly he felt the urge to examine the colonel's communication apparatus; it had a black phone wired up to a radio. He looked at the dirt, the slight hint of sweat, and from there, his eye's turned to his fellow peers. How many of them were there since the beginning in trenches outside Novosibirsk? How many were communists who fought in the last war? How many would be seeing warfare for the first time?\n\nHe examined their uniforms, their stoic resolve, and wondered what the others were thinking. Without a doubt, everyone was anxious, but did they believe there was another way? How many would be stoic when the german shells started to land around them? How many woul-\n\nThe phone rang, Nikolaev didn't see it, but he could feel every single eye look up and sharply at the preceding commander. He kept his eyes locked with the back of Major-Colonel's cap, examining the Olive green. It felt like an eternity, but the only words he heard said were "understood, General Novikov." but every officer in that tent knew what was said. For once, there were no doubts about what was about to come next. Something brutal, horrifying, and something that, even if they lived through, something they would never forget. Even as their hearts became complete with anxiety and dread, they didn't for a moment doubt what they had to do. The Motherland was to be freed, from oppression, dread, and unjust hatred. This wouldn't right the world in its own right, but it was going to start making the world make sense again. The silence was finally broken, the Colonel turned to the rest of the officers in the room and ushered all they needed to hear.\n\n"Get to your units; we're launching in five."\n\nA wave of salutes went up, and the officers stormed out of the tent, putting their caps on, making a few prayers, and all shouting orders to the soldiers on standby. The only thing louder then the shouting over radios and engines coming to life were the jets that flew over the horizon and launching their missiles. Lieutenant Nikolaev had no more questions to ask; they had done all they could to prepare, and the Germans had long made their bed, and it was time to burn it all down."

By the time I arrived, the Aryans had already captured the city.

From above, it all seems so small.\n\nIn Kamchatka and Arkhangelsk, veterans of the Red Navy set aside their politics to battle for the liberation of millions. Their only wish is that they could've won under Bukharin. They weep for those souls lost in the Second World War, and every man, woman, and child burned by the white-hot rod of slavery since those dark days began.\n\nIn Verkhneudinsk and Kazan, men not of Russia prepare to take up arms. Their sacrifices will be remembered as the greatest of all in the decades to come.\n\nIn Ukraine and the Caucasus mountains, old men dig up rifles long buried.

But every time he turned his back, he could feel the bullets ripping through his skin. Wait, was that the whine of a diving aeroplane?

Albert asked out loud.\n\nAlbert would never admit this to any of his colleagues but since the disastrous outcome of the West Russian War, the man had grown to respect the Russians and their seemingly indomitable will. While the Reich has stagnated, even falling into civil war not so long ago, the Russians were rising from the ashes of their failure.\n\nWhen Albert first heard the news of Russian reunification, he would have thought it would have been under a man like Zhukov or the collaborators in Samara. He never would have thought that Vasily Shukshin, a man who hails from the vast rural plains of Siberia, would have brought the Russian nation back together. Yet, Albert could only watch on in surprise as this man who was once unknown to the world seemingly transformed Russian culture, bringing forth ideals of liberty and democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reich refused to move on from its victory in Second World War. While Russia had learned and evolved from its many mistakes, Germany was still stuck in the past. Albert looked to the streets below, watching the Muscovites below go about their business.

As he got closer, he heard violent thumping noises from behind the closed door.\n\nAndrei lifted his foot in the air and slammed his boot onto the door, knocking it wide open. "What is going on in here?!" Andrei demanded as he looked over a brutal scene. A Russian soldier wielding a knife, stabbing into the chest of a crying woman. As he looked around the room, he saw German names, German decorations, blonde-haired individuals in photos. The home of German settlers. Even then, this brutality was... insane.\n\nAndrei wielded his gun like a bat and then smacked the Russian soldier in the face with the stock of his rifle and kicked him off the woman. "Stop, you stupid bastard!" He screamed at the soldier. "President Shukshin told you, didn't he?!" Andrei screamed at his fellow Russian. The soldier staggered in pain. "You.. you are defending the Germans! Are you sympathising with these bastards?! H-He would fire you!" The soldier responded in a fiery rage.

But, he was willing to make sure his generation would be able to not grow up in some backwater town in Siberia. He wanted to save the Russian people and the Russian homeland. To reclaim what was stolen from them by the Fascist powers that be.\n\nThinking about all he had come from, living in Novosibirsk he thought of the fledgling technocratic government shooting into the stars by controlling the anarchy around it and securing its far eastern possessions. The air now was tense and thick with a slight spattering of rain slicking down off of his boots and coating the grass in a soft dew.\n\nThe "border" itself didn't even seem imposing, it was pathetic even. In the distance, there were small outposts one could see with binoculars but other than that it was no wonder so many could get in and out so easily. Vasily thought of maybe just putting a foot over the border in a childlike notion however it was dashed as the stronger voice inside him drove him back.\n\nLeaning on a tree he looked down at his watch "14:56" it read on his arm. The time was near and the fate of Russia hung deep upon him. The countless generations gained or lost by this would be insurmountable.

After decades of oppression, they were just happy to finally be free of all the pain they have endured for years. They won't have to endure slavery and fear persecution. For once in their lives, they were finally free.\n\nGrowing up in the forests of Siberia, under the rule of the Siberian Black Army, Bodgan had never truly known oppression himself. He had always been, for the most part, free from the rule of governments. Even when the Federation under Pokryshkin had taken control of Kansk, his family was left alone. To see be drafted to fight by the All-Russian Army, to march Westward with his fellow Russians just to see how bad things really were. To see a land without freedom, subjugated by a genocidal regime. It made Bodgan sick to his stomach.\n\nBodgan had been thinking of his father during his time in Moscow. He wondered if his father would have been proud of him? For leaving his home and answering the call to free Russia from the rule of Germany. Bogdan sighed as the thought of his mother faded into his mind. He couldn't imagine what see must be feeling now. Terrified for her son, fighting an enemy that wants the dream of Russia to die. To crush Shukshin's vision beneath their boots.\n\nOn the streets, he saw two kids. They were quiet at first, testing the boundaries of what they could do. More and more, they began playing simple games and only became more enthusiastic when nobody tried to stop them. They began laughing, jumping around as they played on the streets. The children, like millions of others across the front, were at last, experiencing true freedom.

Beneath his boots, the muddy soil shifted and writhed as the angry rumble of tanks roared all around him. Quickly raising his rifle, Nikolai put another German flat on his back with a sharp crack. "Kolya!" the Major howled from up ahead, "The fucking Kamchatkans will be in Moscow before you! Move your arse!" Rolling towards them, Nikolai saw yet another groaning row of panzers, infantrymen crawling in their furious shadows like ants. Nikolai's gut flipped and squealed as they approached, but he didn't have the time to retch. His unit had dropped flat on their stomachs as the anti-tank squad loaded their arms. As he stumbled forward, a hand reached up and seized Nikolai's arm, pulling him to the ground. "Kolya," his friend hissed, "Keep down.

"Up, lads!" Major Chernyshev leapt to his feet, as Russian tanks barrelled down on either side of him, "Let's kill some krauts! Forward!"

Rows of tanks crashed into one another like a wave, smoke and flames leaping from their turrets. As the German ants began appearing from behind the hulking panzers, a storm of Russian gunfire was unleashed. Everything faded from Nikolai's mind, and all that he could focus on was making sure his next step was not his last. The battle could have raged for an hour or an eternity. Nikolai didn't know."

"These ruins are in Baku, the former capital of Azerbaijan. They were left here by an act of war. Hundreds died here." \n\n "Here in these ruins can be seen physical evidence of the Third Reich's occupation, and colonization, of the peoples of Europe. But far less tangible are what these ruins mean. And like everything else in this burned and blasted and weary land, they mean survival or extermination, life or death. Depending upon who you talk to." \n\n The camera cuts to an Azerbaijani man, dressed in a grey suit and tie. He speaks as a representative of the Caucasian Reconstruction Zone. \n\n "I think," he says in heavily accented English, "people must realize what we suffered, as a people, before we can heal. There was no security. Not even in your own home, in the heart of the city. The SS could come to your door, knock on your door..." "

How many died, how much damage was done, are still but approximations. Despite the "official" figures offered by the Third Reich. Russian officials estimate the death toll across Caucasia in the millions, perhaps more. Anyone who has wandered through these ruins knows that an exact count is impossible. Why, just a short while ago, a little old man came and told us two children were buried in a hastily dug grave up at the end of the block. And what about these ruins? Have they gone through all of them for buried civilians, and soldiers? And what about the fourteen Azeri men we found in the courtyard behind the post office? Have they been counted? They certainly haven't been buried." \n\n The camera pans out. Behind Cronkite, smoke is billowing from an apartment building. At least, it was an apartment building. Now it looks more akin to a tower of blocks pushed over by a frustrated toddler. \n\n"We came here, to Caucasia, to determine what all this means to the future of our world. Not since the bombing of Pearl Harbor has the barbarity and evil of National Socialist thought been so clear to the people of the Earth. The Germania line, that the Russians are in some way engaging in ethnic cleansing or a racial war against the German people, is not borne out by the evidence. In fact, it is the Russian Federation who has engaged with this war in the best tradition of mankind, as an honourable people, who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.""

Ever since the victory against the Fascist threat, he travelled to the city monthly, sometimes even every other week. On his first trip there, the city was for the most part rubble, and the buildings that remained were unrecognizable mockeries. Clearly Speer's children had been at play in the heart of their conquest. This was unacceptable; the capital of the Motherland deserved better than disfigured Nazi architecture and a crown of ruins.\n\nWithin a day of the official liberation, workers, engineers, and designers went about restoring the city, clearing away the bomb shredded walls and the cracked foundations. For the better part of a year, more than seventy percent of Moscow underwent reconstruction. In addition to houses, apartments, roads, hospitals, schools and an airport, workers installed works of art, statues, and plants, and reconstructed historical buildings under the watchful eyes of several former Decembrists. Museums, art galleries, theaters of both sorts, and multitudes of stadiums popped up on every street corner. The infamous Red Kremlin was restored and expanded, with the intention that it'd become the basecamp of the Federation's presidential and legislative bodies. Other government buildings were built in the Russian Neoclassical style. Brutalism, and the vile miasma that surrounded it, was banished from Moscow's borders forevermore.\n\nPlans for Moscow's Metro system, long abandoned, were revived with modern technology and engineering techniques. In the end, Feniks beat out Titan for the bid by a slim margin. Moscow will have a metro system that will make their opposites in Tokyo and New York blush. By the end of the decade, Moscow will be a new city- a marvel of engineering and culture, connected with its roots yet unafraid to look towards the future."

The Fascist vandals poured concrete temples and forged steel mosques, and dedicated the putrid structures to their own names. Like the Chthonic deities of the past, they demanded blood offerings. In Greece, the old gods called for spring ewes to be thrown into poisonous gorges at midnight; in Reichskommissariat Kaukasia, the dupes and the parasites demanded offerings of human flesh and blood. But just as the light of civilization banished grim Hecate from the hills of Greece, so too will the blaze of democracy and freedom burn away the foul remains of these false gods.\n\nThese mountains, these valleys, these lands that have been soaked in blood and tears will be purified of the National Socialist stain. The monuments to "Aryan ingenuity" will be smashed. The palaces and the plantations will be burnt to cinders. Their children, if they have survived, will be exiled to Germany.  The paintings, the statues, the propaganda that molders in this land will be thrown into the mud like the refuse it is. The cities will be renamed by the people's will. The businesses will be expropriated, and sold to Caucasian citizens.

Shukshin looked up to the Monument of Minin and Pozharsky, now fully restored by the Federation's finest sculptors. \n\n The monument was created in the early 19th century during the age of the Tsars. During the battle of Moscow in 1941, Minin's face had been blown apart by a stray artillery shell intended for Saint Basil's Cathedral. Following the Great Patriotic War, the monument was made a firing range by the Wehrmacht to train their recruits to fire weapons. Vasily remembered just how horrified he had been at seeing the bullet holes that painted the front of the monument. Vasily smiled at the statues of some of Russia's finest, its scars of occupation now gone forever. \n\n Vasily looked behind the statue to the Cathedral itself, which was covered in scaffolding as Russian construction workers continued working tirelessly to restore the iconic building to its former glory. "Tell me, Alexander" Shukshin spoke, getting the General's attention. "Do you ever think things will be like they were before? Before the war and the chaos? Will Germans and Russians ever greet each other as brothers?" Shukshin asked as he places a hand on the smooth stone of the monument.\n\nNovikov was silent for a moment as he thought deeply about the President's question. They had finally beaten the Germans and now, the Motherland was on the long road to recovery but could Russia truly move on from what the Germans had done to her?

We're still rebuilding Ukraine, why are we provoking another nation?"\n\nShukshin laced his fingertips. "It's not about conflict, my friend. It's about showing the people of Ukraine that we care about them, and that the Federation is fighting for their interests. Ukraine has agitated to reclaim Odesa for years. But, under the Germans, they couldn't do anything about their brothers trapped across an arbitrary border. This is the perfect opportunity to gain their trust. If we can get Odesa back for them, it will make working with the Ukrainians much, much easier."\n\nAmet-khan cross his arms, and took a deep breath. "So.

Burning trash cans and raised fists confronted the viewer, practically ready to strike them down on the spot.\n\nHe flipped past several pages. There was the unit he'd stayed with, smiling, a muscular private holding another in a headlock.

However, every time his eyes wandered off the small tent school they had and to the nearby building that was their school. It was several months from completion, but when families heard that the new government would teach Ukrainian, parents demanded their children to head to school at the earliest convenience. Kuzma, on the other hand, had hoped to spend at least a few more weeks goofing off before having such responsibilities like ‘going to school.'\n\nHe recalled his parents stating, "not one once of german would be left in you when you finish your first year." So now, he was stuck in school, watching the freshly painted locomotive place the enormous bricks for the towns first school while his teacher lectured in the background. Kuzma was so lost in thought he didn't even notice when the teacher changed topics from mathematics to local History.\n\n"No matter your background or history, there is one thing all Eastern Europe shares, massive battles that decided the fates of empires. Right over there, in that very field, is where the battle of Poltava took place. The Russian Tsar, Peter the Great, spectacularly defeated the Swedish army and would soon afterwards start what historians have called a Russian Golden Age."\n\n"You mean this isn't the first time the town had to be rebuilt from scratch," thought Kuzma, nonetheless for once, he actually listened to the entire lecture. By the end of the day, Kuzma was called up before he could leave by the teacher. "Kuzma, I noticed that you were paying extra attention today during the history lecture. Do you find that sort of thing interesting?"  Kuzma gave a quick nod, and then the teacher reached underneath his makeshift table and pulled out a book. "Here, Kuzma, it's a book about the history of our nation, one of the first freshly printed books for the entire country, and you can get ahead of the others if you're interested in reading about it."\n\nKuzma was already glazing over whatever the teacher was saying and was looking through the book that was titled simply "The History of Russia and its People," across a solid blue cover, which had a black imprint of a Giant bear across.  He cracked the book open and immediately struggled to read the bigger words, but as soon as he saw them he knew he had to learn what it said. Kuzma expressed great thanks and ran off home, ignoring his friends Andriy and Anna waving to him on the way, and sat right underneath the tree that stood outside his home."

Pride for the country he'd led out of darkness. Pride for the countless lost souls who'd seen their revenge, and those who sacrificed to make the Federation's victory possible. This parade was ten times larger and thirty times grander than what had come before. With every step, they boasted to the world: this is the All-Russian Army, the force that broke the invincible Wehrmacht, the soldiers who liberated millions and crushed a superpower in their palm. It was only one of the miracles his presidency had brought to the Russian wastes.\n\nDread. Only hours ago, Amet-khan had briefed him on the armed forces' apparent inability to contain the rise in pro-Nazi terrorism. The Werewolves, insurgents and radicalized colonists left behind by the Heer's retreat, arming themselves, bombing gatherings, murdering civilians and anyone that put their guard down. Allegedly, even planning an attempt to end his life.\n\nHope. Hope for the future, finally. Moscow and the lands beyond were a bombed out ruin, shattered by decades of enslavement. But they could be rebuilt. The Werewolves could be rooted out, the cities reborn, dead cultures brought back to life. It would be no easy task. But with a bit of blood, sweat, and tears, Eastern Europe could take her place in the Sun.\n\nHe looked to his left. Amet-khan and Pokryshkin stood, smiling, waving to the parade. Pokryshkin leaned over, and shouted in President Shukshin's ear."

 NOV_postwar.32.desc:0 "Page 3 in the Baltic Times: "We cannot, in good faith, urge for completely independent republics for each of the Baltic Republics. But we also cannot believe that we should join the Russian's in their ‘Federation' project. Even assuming the Russians are acting in the best of faith, our nations would become no more than another one of their oblast, purely due to the size of their economy and their population. In a hundred years, the Baltic peoples would speak only Russian. People from Vilnius to Talinin would work on Moscow Time, and disperse themselves across the Federation.This is simply the reality of the situation, and many would call it prosperity."\n\n"This isn't, however, an endorsement of each nation birthing their own independent republic. That would risk ineffectual results. A desire to be truly independent and free of all national constraints is an alluring one, but consider what that means. Each republic will have to depend upon itself to maintain basic functions. Our economic recovery would slow down. We'd be much poorer than the Federation, and the scars of German rule would last longer.\n\n While no one argues for removing ourselves from the security arrangement we have with Russia, dependency is the death of any truly sovereign people. As such, I propose a compromise Position.\n\n Our three Republics, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, share a great deal in common. We've weathered the storms of countless invaders and rulers, and now we stand, after the greatest crime in all of history was conducted on our very land. We, who have so many dark memories and horror stories, share a common bond of unity in the face of such disasters. Our common path ties us together; if there is one thing we take into our future, let it be that shared legacy. Let us form our Confederation, guided not by Moskva but one of cooperation between our peoples. Together we can fund our roads, our schools, and our freedom.

We do not need to become a Russian vassal to escape poverty. Our people must rediscover how to be a sovereign people, a redevelopment that can't come if we must bow and scrape to Moscow every time we want to pass a law. How can we expect the Russians to help us develop our language, our music, our culture?\n\n"The answer to these questions is simple: we must restore the old borders and let our people develop freely and independently of foreign influence.

 NOV_postwar.34.desc:0 "In a radio debate for Radio Vilnius, Ringaudas Songaila vigorously defended ascension into the Federation, making the following arguments.\n\n"Like many others, I love our nation, and to love one's nation; you have to want it to do well. Many opponents of accession have fears of Russian intrusion in our state; others want to depend on a tri-republic to protect our interests. Defenders of both arguments are, to put it bluntly, misguided. The Russians didn't need to march into Riga to ensure their victory. Thousands bled and died for our people to become free. Their willingness to fight demonstrates that the Russians that stepped forth into our lands are far from bloodthirsty tyrants. They're interested in our freedom, and we can see that not only in their willingness to fight for us. Look at the various Autonomous republics of Siberia. Have the Yakuts or Buryats become any less after their integration into the Russian Federation? After the autonomous republic system was fleshed out, they received funds to teach their languages, their cities reclaimed their native names, and are treated as equals. We can see that they've become active members of the Federation; many of those Yakuts and Buryats came into our nation to force the German menace out.\n\n"Here in Lithuania, we can look at the very process in action. The Russians came, and instead of forcing everyone to learn Russian, they're teaching our native tongue to our children! Furthermore, we've talked to the Russian officials; they mean to grant us even more control over our education, laws, budgets, and even government! We can vote for our republic's President, who will be able to exert more power through the Federation beyond our native lands. Does that sound like oppression?""

He felt a great sensation to throw up and struggled to swallow the oncoming shame. \n\n"My…..my parents didn't get a chance to give me a native name, they passed during the fighting, and my older brother was too busy to suggest one." The teacher looked in a way that reminded Liebert of his mother when she looked out the window of their house. The teacher gave a short pause and said, "That's okay, that just means you can pick one; if you're interested, you can stay after class for a bit, and we can chat about it." Liebert felt as if weights were lifted and tried to listen to whatever the teacher had to say for the day; he owned that much to her. At the end of his first written Lithuanian lesson, the teacher gave one great speech. \n\n"It's okay if you didn't understand everything today, but you've all taken the first step in the rebirth of our Lithuanian culture. One day the weights of newfound freedom will rest on all of your shoulders, and with today's lesions, our future can become even more bright than today.\n\nLiebert and the teacher chatted, and he expressed that the teacher's brief speech spoke to him, so the teacher gave one more suggestion.\n\n"Since you seem to value our language deeply, then perhaps your name could be something like Jonas?

Soon enough, his chance appeared, and an old bearded Swedish man stepped down from the ramparts and met with the Latvian and the few Russians around. "This ship has several tons of food, mechanized tractors, as well as radios, and even a few televisions."\n\nEdgar's last memory of television was when the Germans, during their retreat, took everything of value out when the Russians were starting going door by the door for German stragglers.

We survived all this time, and you let the Nazis burn our village as they retreated from Belarus? Why? Why? Why won't you protect your flock?" he said.\n\nThe wind blew, icy cold, as Mikalaj sat in silence. Minutes passed. Then, tens of minutes. Maybe he would freeze to death in the wastes of his home.\n\nBut a glint of light caught Mikalaj's eye. He crawled through the snow, transfixed until his hand struck something hard. He dug into the powdery flakes, uncovering a panel of scarlet glass. He scraped away the frost covering what was once a stained glass window. First, he revealed the Theotokos; then, the naked Christ child, nestled in his mother's loving arms. Just as we are nestled in God's love every day, as old Father Zmicier had told him.\n\nBut, as the snow fell, the dark edge of a blade revealed itself behind the Theotokos' back. No, not a knife- the crude, ink black, bloodsoaked edge of the swastika. It loomed over the Virgin and her son, emanating behind them like the impure light of Satan himself.\n\n"But, Father, I... I had to, they would've..." Mikalaj whispered. Oh, God. He was wrong. \n\n"Oh Christ, forgive me. Forgive me, Father, forgive me," he whispered. "I was wrong. Forgive me."\n\nHe wrenched himself to his feet and looked out onto the horizon. In the distance, he could barely see the buzzing lights of Germania. He folded his hands. "God, protect the people of Belarus, and bring us back to your light," he began. "Protect your eldest sons, the children of Israel. Save them from temptation and suffering." He drew in his breath.

After being cleared for any firearms and explosives by the Russian soldiers, people were now permitted to look inside. While quite a few residents want the bunker gone, it wasn't a priority for the engineers and construction workers who were stretched thin by the long list of jobs they had to attend to, meaning the bunkers would have to remain a little while longer.\n\nThat's when a duo of young men stepped forward, each carrying heavy boxes and set them right outside the bunker. They pulled the top odd and inside it was large buckets of paint and several brushes. One of the two, a young man with a moustache, began painting doves on the side of the bunker. The other painted a Lazavik sitting atop a log. One by one, other started to join in, paiing planes, flags of the Federation, boats, and forests across the enormous canvas that sat int he centre of Minsk.\n\nBy the time that Engineers were scheduled for the destruction of the bunker, it had become a mssive art project that thousands took part in.

Vladimir on the other hand, preferred to stay inside in the shade, avoiding the outside as much as possible.\n\n"Minister?" Desei, India's foreign minister who was accompanying him, asked.\n\n"Sorry, I was just thinking. You Indians are rather admirable. I don't think I could live here for very long here like your people can, that's for sure" Vladimir joked as the two began walking together down the hallway of the Russian Embassy.\n\n"Heh, yes. You northerners grew up in the cold. Very different from India" Desei replied.\n\n"So... has your Prime Minister decided?" Vladimir inquired.\n\n"Yes, he has agreed to an Observer status with the... New Order as you called it. He would believe it to be the most beneficial for India" Desei replied.\n\n"Ah good, President Shukshin will be happy to hear this" Vladimir replied with a smile on his face. \n\nThe two walked in silence, enjoying the silence the Embassy offered before Desei spoke again.\n\n"The Prime Minister was interested in discussing Russian investment in India by Sibir and Feniks. India needs industry and the Prime Minister believes Russia can provide".\n\n"I'm sure we can work out an equitable deal" Vladimir replied enthusiastically as the two exited the hallway and into an office."

Amet-khan Sultan, Hero of the Soviet Union and a skilled pilot, stood slightly shaken at his ally's quick movement. Shukshin briefly looked down at the rubble at his feet.\n\n"We can't just tear down centuries of history, Amet. Moscow was the whole reason we fought and won this war. That was how we rallied our men. That's how we consoled the widows and crying mothers of those fallen. That was our will to fight. To take back Moscow. We can't forsake our duty to all the people who died along the journey just because it doesn't look pleasing right now. Rebuilding takes time." Shukshin stoically responded.\n\nThe pair continued to walk, seeing beggars in the streets and beleaguered citizens shamble along carrying groceries. Sultan spoke up once again. "Why can't we build something new? Something exciting? Have you seen those American cities? They have tall office buildings everywhere and can support a modern economy."\n\n"There's more than enough cities where plans like those can be implemented. But the idea of Moscow, and more importantly the people of Moscow, deserve better than what those cities can provide. Think about how many people would be forced from their homes if we let developers come in and buy up all the land to make office space. No, Moscow's prestige needs to be kept and its people put first," President Shukshin responded.\n\n"I suppose you're right. I'm glad you're taking the current residents of Moscow into consideration, Vasily. Russia should be a place where people of all backgrounds can live in harmony." Sultan enthusiastically said.\n\nThe pair rounded the corner into Red Square. In the distance, scaffolding covered the domes of St. Basil's Cathedral. The structure would be restored to how it was in the days before the occupation. It would serve as the centre of Moscow's skyline, and would signify to the world that Russia was finally back."

At the end of her service as a sniper during the Second West Russian War, the state summoned her to fulfill her duty once again. But this time, she wouldn't be behind a Mosin's scope, but a teacher's desk.\n\nArina could only think of her childhood in Tomsk as she prepared to leave her apartment. She remembered countless days running through the snow drifts outside her home, sprinting down the path to school with a song in her heart. She'd fallen in love with the idea of teaching before she could spell. But then came the wars, the anarachy, the misery. In truth, she'd ended up on the wrong side of the Siloviki's sights when they fought the Republic. It was only the desperation of the period before the reclamation war began that let her pick herself off the streets.\n\nArina shivered as she marched out of her modest apartment. A worried sigh escaped her lips. Was it even possible? A second chance... it seemed almost impossible.\n\nA stocky man stood on a ladder next to the elementary school's door, paintbrush in hand, rewriting the school's name in Cyrillic. Arina couldn't help but admire the dandelion yellow building in the imperial style. It was a meager facsimile of the gymnasiums of old- but function came before splendor, especially in times like these. "Colonel Voronkova!" The painter practically jumped off his ladder as he rushed to greet her. "What a blessing! I've been demanding that the government send us a real teacher for months. The children, bless them, hardly know how to ask for a biscuit in Russian. I've tried, by God I've tried, but-"\n\n"Sir." Arina cut him off, straightening her back into a parade rest. "There's no time for hysterics. Show me inside."\n\n The principal showed Arina to the classroom.

Immense convoys laden with every kind of supplies thundered down the town's dusty roads. A squadron of men in business suits parked outside the historical center. Their assistants set up tents and unpacked reams of paperwork.\n\nIt wasn't long before Young Georgy approached. His nickname was a joke, of course; he was nearing forty-five, muscular and balding, with calloused hands and a dark tan born of years in the fields.

When Alexander first arrived in Moscow, it was a wasteland of ruined buildings and peasants, all coated in dust and ash. The Kremlin itself was barely standing. For a while, Novikov believed the city could never be rebuilt. Yet as he looked around the thriving Kremlin, native Muscovites posing for pictures at the gate, he couldn't be happier to be wrong.\n\nOf course, Moscow was only the first step in the Federation's reconstruction efforts. Most of Western Russia's great cities, including Smolensk, Tver, Tula, Ryazan, Voronezh and many, many others were still struggling to recover from decades of damage. There were some under his command who believed trying to restore what remained of Western Russia was a futile effort. They thought it easier to knock down these Russian achievements and rebuild from scratch.\n\n Perhaps once, Novikov would have agreed. But after seeing what they'd accomplished in Moscow, he couldn't help but scoff at the idea.  If the Great City of Moscow could reclaim its former glory, then the entirety of Western Russia could easily do the same!\n\nWestern Russia shall find its golden age once more, he thought. Soon enough, the memories of glories past would be restored to today. Decades of horror would be erased in a breath, and a golden dawn will rise over the west!\n\n Novikov chuckled as he looked up at the spires of St. Basil's Cathedral.

Beyond the Russians were ink-wasters of every nation; representatives the San Francisco Times, men from the Asahi and Sankei Shimbun, a senior editor of the Press and Journal, and even a cohort from O Globo.\n\nFor Nikitin, it was heaven."Our nascent space program has been extraordinarily successful," he said.

Behind him, a fifty-meter deep pool shimmered with danger and azure beauty.\n\n"Our intention is to advance both German and American designs through collaboration with former members of both programs.

By March of 1973, this chip was incorporated into three hundred and seventy-four major industrial sites throughout America, for the simple fact that it runs faster than a horse on steroids. By November of 1973, the design was purchased by the Department of Defense, and Four-Phase Systems was locked into a permanent, exclusive contract. By January of ‘74, the chip design was leaked to Reich spies. In May of the same year, the German government hired myself and three other Swedes to study how microprocessor technology could be incorporated into future Reich aerospace endeavours, including a potential mission to Mars," he said.\n\nHe smiled, and locked eyes with the nearest guard.

Thus came forth the womb that would bear the fruit of Russian ingenuity. A great slab of concrete was poured and sheltered from the rain, as any father would shelter their only daughter. At midnight upon the seventh day of the month, as the concrete lay drying, a lone soul crept into the poorly secured building site. Frydrik Myuler, the last scion of Velimir the Great, offered a prayer to Perun and pressed his severed finger into the drying concrete. A sacrifice, for the strength of the Russian people.\n\nThen came the bones. Great beams of steel, carved from the flesh of mountains, laid down upon a plain swept by tools of men. A month passed, and the spirit of the great monument was outlined by its fathers. Two months and the beast took shape. Three, and the bones knit together into a skeleton. Again, Myuler snuck into the launch site and painted a sacrifice of his own blood upon the holy girders. A sacrifice, for the hope of all Russians. Next came forth the beast's veins. Pipes, imported from factories in Samara, entwined with a septic heart. Great ducts of flimsy aluminium, clumsily pressed together, formed the titan's lungs. Wires laid down in Amur crossed the vastness of Russia to become a nervous system. By now, the government had erected security fences around the half-born creation. Myuler dug under the fences, entered the facility, and smeared his breath, his phlegm, and his bile upon the naked electrical system. A sacrifice, that Russian should be spoken in the heavens.\n\nFinally, the labor was complete. A skin of fibreglass and brick stretched over the beast, covering its blessed organs and completing the facade of normalcy. Yuri, as Frydrik was known to his work team, stood silently as an Orthodox priest cried false blessings over the Barnaul Space Center. His acrid incense and meaningless utterings billowed over a gathering of every soul that had labored to complete the Center. But it was useless. Nothing hallowed to Perun can be taken from him; not the Earth, nor its men, nor humanity's creations. All of it belonged to Him.

 NOV_postwar.64.desc:0 "For the first time in a long while, the presidential quarters in Novosibirsk were quiet, with most of the staff sleeping deep into the morning.  No one could blame them; for the first time in generations, the People of Russia were genuinely free. Not only were they free, but they faced the German onslaught, in the sky and on the ground, and came out victorious. Today, Russians every stood with their backs straightened. They had achieved something that previous states, the Soviets, the Americans, even the British, had failed to do. They had defeated what was the greatest evil in known history and came out better for it.\n\nThe euphoria of the previous day of celebration left the staff completely knocked out with their success; even the various generals drank as if it were their weddings.  As the staff of the Presidential Palace slowly returned over the next day, they started to return to work on the now significant backlog of documents and information. Shukskin, who also slept in, enjoyed the relative quiet, but he knew he had to return to work. Atop his desk sat several documents, giving relatively brief descriptions of the situation across the newly gained territory, as well as widespread damage reports and potential avenues toward reconstruction.\n\nAfter reading through each and hearing about the various suggestions and policy plans, one of Shukskins advisor's spoke up. "There's also the matter of the new Security minister, he's agreed to stay around for a few more weeks, but he will need a replacement. Thankfully he's left us with a recommendation."\n\nThe advisor handed Shuskin a stapled together set of papers, and the president read the documents aloud. "A little young, but served in the battle of Moskva with valour, extremely dedicated, and a quick learner, he'll start coming next tomorrow to make sure he understands how things are run here, and then hopefully we'll be left in good hands."\n\nShukskin gave a slight nod and asked the advisor to get him some coffee; today would be a long day."

So, it was no surprise when the new Marketplace was announced. What did surprise her was that the dingy old marketplace was replaced by more than a few stalls. Instead of stalls, the old marketplace was replaced by an actual building. It had bright lights assorted in the colours of the Federation, and as soon as she stepped across the threshold inside, she immediately felt a wall of heat. After experiencing the heat, something even her home struggled to get, she looked down what was aisles of food items and goods. The shock of the quality was only beaten by the prices she saw.\n\nFirst on her list was Caviar, followed by Kvas, and then a myriad of other food goods. When the total came up, it was significantly cheaper than what her family had been paying before. As she pulled out cash for the total, the lady behind the register dressed in Sibir clothing started a conversation.\n\n"Miss, I'm obligated to let you know we're looking for more people to hire, our more qualified staff are often moving from different locations to help start-up various stores throughout the liberated territories."\n\nAnna pondered, it would be nice to be a warmer place during the winters, and the pay would mean the family wouldn't need to depend on her parents' funds.

 NOV_postwar.66.desc:0 "In a country often viewed as incredibly impoverished, Russia has started to experience a genuine change in fate. In what many economists have begun to call "the miracle on the Volga", the Russian economy has begun to flourish due to many factors. For one, Russian businesses have regained access to the core Russian heartland, meaning many more customers and opportunities for expansion and development. Following the war, the Russian Federation turned the billions stored for the armed forces into economic growth to develop and encourage new and old industries coupled with a massive amount of infrastructure development. A particular example that demonstrates Russia's resolve into developing into a true superpower is its investments in advanced technologies.\n\nThat example is the New Millenia program, which aims to turn the Russian Federation into a juggernaut of electronic development. Currently, the program is intended to develop standardized systems and teach up to a million by 1980 in various aspects of computer science development. The New Millenia is but one programme; other programmes have targeted automobiles, heavy machinery, and consumer goods. These programmes have been coupled with an aggressive infrastructure development plan, making the travel of goods easier than any other point in Eurasian history.\n\nIn addition to new industries, the Russian Federation has taken an active approach to focus on the developing parts of the economy that the global economy lacks, rather than broadly developing industries across all sectors. What made this sharp focus possible was the coordination between the Russian Government under President Shukskin, the Major Companies of Russia, and the rapidly growing ‘middle class.'  The reason cited by the economic ministry is that Russia rests now in a crucial place where it has sufficient resources to develop important sectors of the economy and maintains decent relations with the Sphere and warm relations with the OFN. Additionally, with Germany's defeat, the rest of Europe is eager to start trading with the Russian Giant and escape the german influence. The result of this position is a massive power able to take part in most of the major world markets, taking the best from each and using that knowledge and access to build a life beyond what most Russians believed was possible just a decade ago."

Constructed during the German occupation, the lumbermill was typically a quiet, cold place until the first Russian troops swept through the building during the war. One of the first things that changed was the flag, and now bright, cheery colours of the Federation adorned the pole that sat outside. Now, the workers weren't afraid to not only look at the flag they lived under but also at the stars that hung above them.\n\nUnder the summer sun of Belogord, a group of young students took their stipend out to a freshly built commercial district. They wanted to flair up their clothing and maybe even buy some makeup. Only after all the laughter and celebrating did they realize they had spent too much, and several the next day had to make a call home. Despite having to call home, none had to worry if they would see their families again.\n\nWithin Moscow's first reconstructed Synagogue, a sight no one inside would have believed only a year ago would ever happen again, a public Bar Mitzvah was held. Not only did the fear of their entire culture being eradicated leave their mind for that moment, but they could be happy about the future for the first time. Among the tears and laughter that followed, they danced deep into the night, knowing this was but the first of many nights.\n\nThroughout the massive motherland, the people celebrated, danced, and sang songs many thought were lost. In a place typically thought of as a cold and unforgiving place, the people of the Federation found warmth in the passion they now had in freedom."

Weapons shipments?"\n\nStepan couldn't believe what he read; it seemed like Russia had bigger plans. Freeing Poland seems like an impossible endeavour, but anything that drives Germany more up against the wall would ultimately be a victory for the free world. He grabbed another file from the stack and opened it.\n\nThe Ma clique? he thought they were under Japanese control, but it appears that's not the case, another Chinese republic? That's bound for trouble, but both China and Russia could get far together with the right people, like Stepan.\n\nHe kept reading more files; Mongolian uprisings and nomad cooperation in Ulaanbaatar, they'd gladly accept Russian help. Stepan did wonder how the Co-prosperity sphere would react to this but considering that the Federation showed its might against Germany, they would probably back down.\n\nArmenia? That's a name he hadn't heard for a while, a nation that might have even suffered more than Russia did.\n\nThere are still some rebel groups whose fires are still burning, and Russia would provide the wood they needed.\n\nSurely Turkey wouldn't mind.\n\nStepan looked at the stack and smiled; he remembers when one man repaired the Russian nation, and once again, Russia will repair other countries.\n\nHe grabbed another one as he looked down into his mug, empty."

His old, beaten shoes drummed awkwardly on the footpath and he could feel the cold seeping through the leather already. He just smiled, however. How could he not? There was the familiar smell of sweet flowers in the air and the jewel-like glow of fresh, green leaves. Russia was in bloom once more, and Valery swelled with joy, that he had lived to see it.\n\nNot so long ago, any dreams of an end to occupation had seemed far-off and fragile. The very joy of life, that Valery savoured now, had been sealed under lock and key in iron freight trains and deported away into the black heart of the Reich. When the Federation had spread its wings and crossed the Reich's border, Valery, and so many others, had cowered in the darkness, afraid to join their eastern brothers for fear of the retribution the Führer would wreak upon the Russian Federation after beating the armies of Russia once more.\n\nThe Federation's defeat had never come, however. All across western Russia, similar scenes of ecstasy erupted like blossoms. From the forests of Pskov to the wide plains of Orel, a thousand Valerys leapt to their feet to aid in the reconstruction.\n\nValery felt his old joints creak as he heaved buckets of wet concrete. He felt his feet drag ever so slightly as he hurried to help. But as he and twelve other Russians pulled on the rope, tearing the swastika down from above Smolensk city hall, he felt the return of emotion long forgotten: pride.

She flicked a switch, composing herself as she activated her comms.\n\n"Colonel Ivanov, this is Captain Anna. I'm approaching now. Tell the boys to get their toys ready".\n\n"Copy that, Captain.

He worked producing rifles, a thankless task, providing the means for the Germans to oppress his people. A single slave producing a rifle incorrectly would lead to hours of collective punishment. The soul-crushing work never ended.\n\nWhen the Russian army had smashed down the door of his factory, he was utterly terrified, two of the guards had begun "liquidating" the "assets", successfully murdering half of the people Konstantin knew in the world. The army only got to them just as Konstantin's overseer had turned his attention to him. His life was saved, and for that, he was grateful to them. The men then introduced themselves in Russian, and for the first time in years, Konstantin spoke a language that his masters- no, former masters- had tried to force him to forget.\n\nOne day he left the small apartment he rented, it was better than the conditions in the factory housing, but he still didn't like to be cooped up all day. As he walked down the street he saw something odd. He noticed a line of people all standing outside a building. The building declared itself to be a government soup kitchen. Something about it made him smile. The factory he grew up in would never provide something as substantial as soup to eat unless you worked for it as if your life depended on it. \n\nAs he walked on, he saw two children playing soccer in the street. Soccer. That was something he was introduced to by the soldier that had aided him in rehabilitation. A game that people played to keep themselves occupied. One of the kids kicked the ball a bit skew, and it nearly hit a window. Under German rule, they would be punished severely. He kicked the ball back, and the child smiled.\n\nHe made his way down another small bend, to a road that had been repaired by the reconstruction crews. He could see the school they had been building, it was going to allow admittance to over 200 students for free. On the steps of a school, a woman was reading a book to three eager looking, kids. He was grateful that they would not experience the life he had lived.\n\nAs he looked at the book she was holding, an idea struck him. He ran back to his home, and in a spark of inspiration, took a few sheets of paper and a pen. He wrote and wrote until he was tired. He looked back at the paper, reading the first few lines. He would need an editor, someone who could make his ramblings and bad grammar read better, but he could make this work.

But across the table sat Roman Levitsky, COO of Titan Research and Development, and Sergei Novlischev, CGO of Sibir Community Lending. Each of them was just a cog in the machine.

I haven't heard anything about this," he said.\n\n"In light of the Federation's orientation away from the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Feniks has devised a strategy to access the Mongol market, and through it a broad East-Asian consumer base," Langemak said. "We intend to take advantage of the instability in the Mengjiang region to empower rebellious liberal elements, as well as restless tribal groups. By arming and supplying the opposition, the Federation will find itself in an optimal negotiating position to obtain favourable trade agreements in a newly born state isolated from its neighbours."

I thought those Communists were more eager to subjugate us, like the Germans. It's odd seeing foreigners who care about our people," Yusif said.\n\n"No, no, the Russians are not Communists. Well, not anymore! They're more like Americans now. Fighting for liberty! Battling for democracy! ‘For the liberation of all Russians!" Giorgi said. His powerful emphasis of the Russian President's catchphrase earned a snicker from Yusif.\n\n"Ah, that's right! But we're not Russian, my friend. How do you know we can trust these people? What if they're just softening us up just to smack us down again?" the Azeri asked.\n\n"I'm not so sure, my friend. I suppose we'll just have to trust the Russians this time around. After everything Germany put us through, anything this Federation does will be a million times better than the things the SS did to us," Giorgi said. In the distance, a young girl with freckled cheeks waved the Russian tricolor with a smile on her face.\n\nYusuf sat back in his chair, thinking on his friend's words."

For the poles of the Republic, many felt that so long as their cultural autonomy was guaranteed, there wasn't much to complain about, especially after the years of anarchy. Then Shukskin started dropping massive amounts of development into the Nowa Polish Republic, and so by the time the Second West Russian War started, the republic served as a model Autonomous Republic. When the Federation went west, Nowa Polska served as the model and dream to convince the various ethnic groups of Eastern Europe to assist in the war against German Oppression.\n\nAs the war traveled west, the Polish within the Federation gave everything they could, serving with distinction, after all, who knew the cost of defeat by the Germans then the Polish People. When the news reports showed the frontlines getting ever closer to the homeland, the Polish people thought maybe the nightmare would finally end. Finally, when the Federation's army was shown to be right at their ancient homeland's gates, the streets were filled with anticipation and pride. "Maybe," they thought, many hoped to visit their relatives or travel to their old home, and the people of Poland could be rejoined, and maybe another miracle at the Vistula would come.\n\nThen the ceasefire was declared.\n\nUnlike the rest of the Federation and the liberated territories, Nowa Polska and the Poles of the Federation had relatively quiet celebrations. They understood why it had to be done, but it didn't make the pain of the loss any more easier. Nonetheless, the Federation president and the Autonomous Republics' president Stanisław Skalski kept being adamant about eventually freeing Poland from German oppression. So the Poles of the Federation went back to their daily lives, keeping the story of Poland alive within the Federation, knowing that someday, an opportunity to free their homeland would arise.\n\nLittle did they know it would start with the redeployment of the Nowa Polska regiments to western Ukraine."

When they arrived at the military installation near the Polish border, he was surprised by the raw number of people in rather plain clothing.\n\nOfficially, they were polish refugees attempting to flee the violence in the war and were now stuck within the Federation. Unofficially, they were the first batch of proud Poles who were to be trained and equipped to jumpstart the Second Polish Uprising.

There will be no negotiations about ‘reintegration' or ‘subjection,' the nation of Poland is, as of today, without any shred of doubt, a proud and free nation.

The road to rebuilding our homeland will be a long and arduous one, but with assistance from our Russian allies to the East, we will lift ourselves out of the darkness and back into the holy light. Furthermore, elections will be held by year's end to usher forward our new democratic and free era! \n\nTo the German Reich, I have nothing but disdain, and I hope that the people of Germany learn to reject the so-called "National Socialist" rule.

From Englishmen to the Japanese, I ask you all, has this madness from nearly forty years ago made the world a better place? Have your people been made richer, both in soul and materially?

He had earned his stripes years ago during the Narodnik insurgency, back when the Federation was little more than a city state. When his unit was appointed to deal with a "Werwolf" problem in Moscow, he knew the drill. Many of his superiors objected to his method of trying to find the ring leader instead of breaking up smaller cells, but Morozov believed that cutting off the head of the snake was more efficient than cutting off its tail.\n\nAnd his methods eventually bore fruit. After a while of listening on wiretaps, collecting info from informants and some "enhanced" interrogation sessions, the Spetsnaz finally located the leader of the Moscow chapter. They tracked the leader to an unassuming house in the outskirts of the city, which belonged to a certain "Boris Ignatyev" also known as "Garmr" to his Werwolf allies. In the middle of the night, Morozov and his men stormed the lonely house, determined to take "Garmr" dead or alive. Unfortunately for them, the house was seemingly deserted, until one of the Spetsnaz discovered a hidden door behind a bookcase. It was hastily opened, and the door opened to a staircase that lead to a secret basement. The unit went down into the basement to discover a makeshift operations room, filled with maps, documents and weapons. The Spetsnaz discovered a man attempting to use the radio to send messages in German, possibly to warn his Werwolf allies that he's been discovered. A voice in Russian yelled at him to stop and turn around slowly with his hands up. Instead of complying, the man tried to pull a gun on the Spetsnaz; and within seconds, "Garmr" was dead.\n\nThe Spetsnaz and Russian intelligence agents combed through the documents found and discovered that they've stumbled upon treasure. The man that they killed wasn't named "Garmr" or "Boris" but named "Lutz Hoffmann", an agent of the German Abwehr, tasked with organizing the Moscow chapter of the Werewolves. With the intelligence gathered at Hoffmann's headquarters the Russians found out about every cell, every safehouse , every supply route, and every planned attack. The next few weeks saw a crackdown of epic proportions. Hundreds of German Werewolves dead and thousands more taken prisoner.

Now, he is stationed there alongside a garrison, at the heart of old Belarus, but also one that was struck the hardest.\n\nThe German influence is seen all over, from the architecture to the signs, and especially all the settlers in the area. It made him uneasy, thinking about how horrible the place was before they showed up. Despite this, he'd heard tales from some soldiers stationed in other neighbourhoods; about how a lot of Belarusians didn't enjoy having their houses blown up. But he's just a private, he thought, so Anton didn't worry too much about anything like that happening. He could just direct them to his superiors and watch the shitshow unfold. He cracked a wry grin as the thought passed through his mind.\n\nHe passed through the city, essentially off-duty, but still wearing his military fatigues and carrying his rifle. With the reconstruction going on, he must be alert at all times, or so the commanders tell him. Anton thought the city was doing just fine, especially considering how happy the people seemed to be at the Germans being kicked out. As he thought all of this, a scent wafted by him, something warm and impossibly comforting. He immediately followed the scent down the street, checking each corner and alleyway and passing by several soldiers eating the very thing he craved out of massive bowls. His stomach began to rumble; whether or not he was hungry before, he sure was now.\n\nEventually, he arrived at what initially appeared to be a meager stall, with an old man, probably in his 60's or 70's, and a young woman. Around the stall sat many soldiers, once again eating the same delight Anton had been looking for.

Russia was back on the world stage, and it wasn't going to waste time proving it. As such, it was only natural that one of the first conversations over that desk was what to do with China.\n\n"The Ma's are, as you know, a political faction within Northwestern China; they've held out for decades against Japanese pressure and harbour interest to overthrow the Japanese. Furthermore, they're ideologically varied but not stringent on any particular beliefs. The Ma's are classical Kuomingtang believers, especially the current leader, Ma Jiyuan; ideally, they want democracy and develop China, meaning nothing we would want or suggest to them would be outside of their wheelhouse. In short, they're malleable to our interests and needs, and we can trust they'll be willing to cooperate with us.

Nonetheless, it can serve as a thorn, and if given the right resources and the right crisis, they could swing eastward and establish their regime. Even if they don't liberate the rest of China anytime soon, having a state between us and the heart of the Sphere that is aligned with us would help us wonderfully. We can build up another market that our businesses can work in, strengthen our image globally, bolster our security, and hopefully make a long-term ally. In short, it's an all-around beneficial idea to help them develop and take over the region, especially if we're planning on a longer-term confrontation with the Sphere."\n\nThe president started to fix his sitting position only to utter all the words he needed to, "In that case, then you can get to work with the KMT, send an envoy and start sending supplies along with advisors and support.

Only a few years ago did Russia look like this, but despite it, not only did the Federation pull itself up, it stood up to the Germans and came out victories. The Chinese can do the same, especially if given the right push.\n\nA few minutes passed, and finally, a freshly dressed officer appeared outside his doorway and announced that Ma Jiyuan was finally to meet with the Russian envoy. To Rustam's surprise, Ma Jiyuan was far more plane-looking than he expected. He proudly wore his military uniform, with bright and clean Kuomingtang symbols. But the eyes he had betrayed both his sadness and strength. Jiyuan had been fighting longer than most Russians had; it was clear that for him, the war never ended. The first words he heard uttered were not bold promises but an apology.\n\n"I'm sorry for not preparing adequately for your arrival, but we didn't have much clue of when you would be arriving or from what direction; therefore, we haven't prepared food or any of the etiquette fit for a representative of your nation."\n\nRustam was quick to affirm the general, "Please, you needn't worry. I grew up in a Russia that was being bombed regularly. I understand your position and difficulty perfectly, so you needn't apologize. The one thing I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt is that we understand your struggle, and that is why we're here to help. I'm to become the permanent representative of the Russian Federation to your government. Furthermore, I'm here to inform you numerous supplies and support are to come to assist you and your government in the reclamation of China, starting with the west."\n\nMa Jiyuan seemingly had weights taken off his shoulders when the admission of aid was uttered.

As the tensions grew higher, the various Duma members and the military brass in the room joined in the debate between the two titans of the Federation. And at the head of the table, President Vasily Shukshin sat stoically, following the back and forth with great attentiveness.\n\n"The economic benefits of bringing ourselves closer to the OFN would be enormous! Imagine the American capital that could flow into the nation. We could rebuild Moscow twice as fast, and double the accessibility of consumer goods! It would create a Russian renaissance!" Amet-Khan Sultan passionately proclaimed.\n\n"Russia has the necessary corporate structure to be a competitor to the United States! Are we simply going to let western CEOs wipe the floor with our hardworking Russian companies? Our people are nothing if not full of grit and determination. Our economy is built for global capitalism!" Alexander Pokryshkin countered.\n\nShukshin's mind raced. Whatever decision was made here would steer Russia's place in 20th century history. The humiliation, and triumph, and everything in between led to this choice. Should Russia brave the storms of the world alone? Can it? How close can Russia be to the OFN without submitting to the Americans?\n\nPokryshkin began to raise his voice. "You want to sell us out to the Americans! How can you call yourself Russian, you Tartar bas-"\n\n"Alexander, please. You both make valid points. Both of your views are informed by different worldviews, which I shall not try to police. Alone, we can build our own, opposing democratic bloc. But together, we can fight the tides of fascism until it is fully eradicated." the President calmly said.\n\nShukshin paused as he pondered his next words.  "Gentleman. It is clear that…"

So they ate noodles and talked about the white and black striped butterflies they saw outside.\n\n"Where's Baba?" Li Jing asked.\n\n"He won't be home for a few more hours, my petal. Are you ready for your bath?" Mama said. Jing let Mama wash and braid her hair, but it was no fun without Baba.\n\n"Where's Baba?" Li Jing asked.\n\n"He hasn't finished his shift, little one. Come read with me," Mama said. Of course, Jing knew all the stories by heart. But it wasn't the same without Baba's silly voices.\n\n"Where's Baba?" Li Jing asked.\n\n"He can't tuck you in tonight, my heart. But he left me a kiss to lay on your forehead," Mama said. Jing smiled sadly and laid down to sleep.\n\nAt midnight, Li Jing heard the front door close. "Baba, is that you?" she said.\n\nBaba laughed. "Yes it is!" he said. "I missed you, beloved."\n\n"I missed you. Why were you gone so long?" she asked. "Baba has to work, little one," he said. "We need money for rent. But never mind that, look what I got for you!" \n\nHe pulled a cloth doll from his pocket. It was the size of a child's hand, made of soft fabric, with buttons for eyes and a tiny scrap of red silk for a heart.\n\nLi Jing took the doll and smiled. "I love it, Baba! Thank you!"\n\nHer father knelt and kissed her on the cheek. "I love you, my daughter.""

The night sky above cloaked the landscape in darkness, and the fire crackled softly, its tempo erratic. In his hands, a relic of the past. It was another night, for Davit... if that was something to find pride in, now. His hands, calloused and scarred, gripped firmly along the edge of the photo. Its dusty, black-and-white colouration was illuminated by the flickering flame in front of him, with the smudged little figures only slightly visible.\n\nHis eyes quietly drifted along the front, eyes looking upon those grainy little figures. He'd seen this sight perhaps a thousand times over, now- had sat aside this campfire over and over again, after days worth of fighting. His thumb, running softly along the side of the photo, ever slightly ruffled its dirty white edges. He could still remember their voices, occasionally. Could remember their smiles- their laughter, even in the face of their circumstances before. Their youth..that which was stolen from them. Perhaps, back then they'd have been here, sitting by his side. Perhaps, he wouldn't have had to be the only one left- perhaps there could've been some hope, for the future of their people. They'd called themselves Fedayi for a reason- 'those who sacrifice'. That was not the case, for him.\n\nAnoush, Tigran, Arax..all gone, now. \n\nHe'd fought for so long, now..since he was a young boy. He'd fought for Armenia, yet- he had yet to die for Armenia. He'd lost his friends, his family...he'd lost what made it anything to him. His teeth, under the scraggly beard that adorned his face, were tightly grit. The feelings within him, he could not describe- a concoction of rage and hurt. Was this his fate? To fight forever, for the sake of a people that he could never feel the joys of?\n\nHe would either die or be alone. Either meet his end, or, by some means- kill, and kill, and kill, until he finally stood alone, atop a mountain of corpses with which nobody else to finally appreciate the view. What could be won here? Would it ever be worth it?\n\nDavits face, pampered with dust and soot, had been disturbed by the solemn flow of red-hot tears. There was no means of controlling it, anymore- nothing to hold him back. He missed them, he missed his family-he damned every god possible and damned the Turk. None of it would soothe his pain, and none of it would end this cycle.\n\nUnder that night sky, that son of Armenia sobbed..."

After carefully considering both Sultan's and Pokryshkin's proposals, he had reluctantly decided to go with what the latter had planned. What would the future have in store? Would the Americans start to treat them the same way they had treated the Japanese and Germans?\n\nWiping off the sweat that had accumulated on his forehead, Shukshin sighed as he stared at the nearby clock that constantly reminded him how many hours he had wasted rewriting the speech he was going to give tomorrow, announcing the birth of the CSTO. However, just as he was about to finish jotting down the final lines of his speech, the President was rather unceremoniously interrupted by Alexander Pokryshkin.\n\nBursting into the room unannounced, the Falcon was grinning from ear to ear, likely still euphoric from his victory against Sultan earlier that day. "Vasily, excellent news! My men have gathered information on more countries likely to join our new alliance!"\n\n"Easy for you to be excited, Alexander. You're not the one who has to deal with all the paperwork," the writer muttered, scribbling something on a spare piece of paper.\n\n"How could I not be? This marks the end of decades of Russian humiliation, Vasily, for the All-Russian Army will truly be the mightiest in the world! Historians will call this moment the beginning of the Russian Century!"\n\nShukshin could only nervously chuckle as he stared out of the window at the evening sunset. Sure, he could be making a terrible mistake, and although part of him continued to insist that the OFN was the safer option, the other half couldn't help but dream. He couldn't help but dream of a harmonious world at peace led by his victorious Russia. His dreams, Pokryshkin's dreams, the populace's dreams... "

History had seemingly repeated itself, Putin declaring the city independent from the illegitimate government in Novosibirsk and breaking away, stating that the Tomsk administration is the 'true government' of the Russian Federation.\n\nThis move has been met with outrage from Poktyshkin's inner circle with demands that what remains of the All-Russian army be mobilized to put down the rebellion in Tomsk. With the situtation of the Federation spiraling out of control, the President must consider all his options carefully if he wishes to reunite the Motherland once more."

Please send soldiers here." Dmitri responded. The radio commander called the closest thing he could find, a military base in Kyzyl. "Reporting an emergency. Immediate military presence in Irkutsk oblast required. A rebellion has grown." he ordered.\n\nThe soldiers would try to cross into Irkutsk as per request, but right at the edge of the oblast, bullets hailed upon them. Armed men and women declared the area as a no-pass zone, and the socialist revolutionaries fended off the battalion of the Federation's soldiers. A gruelling battle for the already war-torn nation, not another battalion was sent. Soon, the entire Far East had gone silent. The revolutionaries had seized everywhere from Irkutsk to the Amur basin.\n\nFrom the Baikal, the citizens watched Chulkov speak from the seas of Lake Baikal, as he shouted into a megaphone from the Storozhevoy. "Alexander Pokryshkin is a traitor and a criminal, he has willingly suppressed the people, suppressed the people's voices, and thrown away the semblance of democracy that Shukshin set up, but can he stop us if we are in masses?!" Chulkov shouted from a ship. "No!" The crowd responded. "Then I declare, we must rise against the snake and create a true socialist paradise! Pick up arms and fight! We have to be brave, strong fighters for a new future!"\n\nAnd then the word spread across Siberia. His words have inspired many to defect from the Federation and join the socialist revolution. City after city was seized in the Far East, and all access was blocked to the region by those filled with rage against the machine, men and women who had armed themselves and fought hard. Across the Far East, the tricolours of Russia have been knocked down, and the flag of the newly declared Far Eastern Soviet Republic flew in its place."

Boris Yeltsin, the democrat from Yekaterinburg filled a hole in many hearts, becoming a figure of leadership for those who still believed in the democratic dream. But protest after protest, Pokryshkin's boot of authority still stuck like gum, even when the people's call for changes was unanimous across the country. This made it clear to Yeltsin.\n\nThere was never going to be a change of heart in the pilot. And so, when nothing can change a tyrant, the people must resort to an alternative method: rising their fists in the air and declaring a rebellion. Yeltsin knew it was all that was necessary for the future of democracy. After rallying many to his side, he moved to his homeland in the Urals and began a struggle against the regime that was strangling the will of the people so tightly. He had begun the rebellion. Thousands of upset Russians, rifles in hand, ready to strike the oppressors that stand in their way.\n\nQuickly, large swaths of lands were occupied by the rebellion. And then, officially in the centre of Yekaterinburg, the Declaration of the Ural Republic was read out by Boris Yeltsin, and a new Republic now springs into existence, planning to bring back the old days of Shukshin, with prospering democracy, not with the oligarchical clutches of Pokryshkin. Now every Russian within the borders of the Ural Republic will have a chance at once again voting, Yeltsin thought.\n\nBut there was a long path ahead. Russia was cracking at the seams once again.

Previously the leader of the Anti-Communist Guard in Onega, the traitor has seemingly come out from hiding to establish a neutral Russian state. by staging a mass rebellion in our western lands. With the morale in the All-Russian army at an all-time low, loyalist army units were effortlessly sent into an unorganized retreat to the Urals with almost zero resistance barring brief skirmishes with the traitors. In less than a week, our control over Western Russian has almost entirely dissipated, with a new ‘Western Russian Republic' being declared in the remainders of our European territories. \n\nAs the news spreads like wildfire throughout the angry Russian populace, partisans have begun to spring up in almost every corner of the Federation, utilizing this utter embarrassment to their advantage and stoking the flames of revolution once again.

Pokryshkin sat down in the waiting room of the hospital when doctors approached him.\n\n"Vasily Shukshin... declared deceased at 3:45 PM." The doctors said. Pokryshkin looked down, a sad feeling sweeping him by storm, a frown coming across his face. The news would hit the Russian nation, what was left of it, and the people would mourn the lost President. Many cried, many were disappointed. Few were happy. Under the articles of the Federation, however, the Presidental spot would fall under Alexander Pokryshkin, the Head of Government.

First, a few heavily armed soldiers came out, blocking the protestors from going any further. Defiant, the people spit in the faces of the armed soldiers, yelling obscenities. Another truck. Then another one. The soldiers began aggressing, and the protestors returned fire, whether it was chucking back tear gas at the soldiers that had been tossed at them or using their fists to fight off batons. The situation only went downhill from there.\n\nAnd then, an immediate order was barked to the soldiers. Their assault rifles came out, and one bang was enough to disperse the entire crowd. Flashes in the air were accompanied by continued ongoing fire along with blood spraying all over the place and the screams of the unfortunate. Many were caught in the crossfire, and more would lose their lives that night, but the soldiers were made to clean up the corpses and carry on as nothing had happened.\n\nBut the incident couldn't stay isolated. A massacre, in the Federation's capital city? The story spread around Russia like a plague. Many were enraged. The Shukshinites were fuming, as well as the socialists.

How symbolic that this village was to be occupied during the Second West Russian War. Shukshin's forces couldn't hold the area. Konstantin had hoped that soon salvation would come. He prayed, day and night to God and in all that was Holy, that the Federation would prevail and liberate the village and that those Russian soldiers would come marching through the streets chanting cries of victory with those they had saved. But the occupation went on for days. Then weeks. And finally, months. And at last, it was announced that the Federation had lost the war. Konstantin lost all hope that he had left.\n\nThe loss haunted him. He never wanted to be subservient to fascism. His father had supported the soldiers of the Red Army in the first failed war in the 50s. And when Konstantin had put 'Vasily Shukshin' in the ballot box, he saw a strong fighter for the future, one which would be able to liberate what was left and avenge the fallen. That is what he cared about the most. He just couldn't bear the idea of licking the boots of Reichskommisars to survive. And that is why he was packing his bags, stuffing whatever he could into them. Clothes. Money. Food. Necessary supplies just to survive. He was not going to stay. He refused to bow his head for the fascists.\n\nHe loaded all his supplies into a truck, looking back at his home one last time. He had lived here all his life. He remembered when his mom used to cradle him and his dad used to carry him. He recalled sneaking in after spending the night with his girlfriend, and the harsh scolding his father gave him the morning after. A small tear rolled down his eye, but the past was the past. Surely they'd understand his decision if it was in the name of escaping the fascist bastards. He loaded his truck and floored it to the border.\n\nHe had learned enough German to speak with the border guard, and stuffed enough cash into his bag to bribe even the most duty-bound guard.

Scurrying off from the increasingly loud sounds, the road began to fill with trucks full of supplies, soldiers, and weapons. They were seemingly preparing for something.\n\nThroughout the Kazakh territories, this picture was echoed across every highway. A web of supply and troop movements had begun, movements which Pokryshkin was completely unaware of. The real intentions of these movements were clear: the preparation of Kazakh liberation from the tight control of the Russians. They would fight tooth and nail to secure their independence from the crumbling nation that had hurtled them into war against the fascist beast.\n\nIn solidarity with the feelings of their homeland, many of the fielded Kazakh generals have chosen to defect in secrecy, no longer serving the Federation. They now serve Altay Amanzhol Mukanov who, since the failure of the Russian nation, has decided the Kazakh people have no more interest in serving beneath the Russian Federation. Instead, it is time to free them from the chains of Russian control, and make a new flourishing Kazakh nation. Under this movement, the man has become a local hero, forming a growing cult of personality with those who also wish to no longer serve Pokryshkin.\n\nAnd now, it was time for their strike. Supply lines have been cut, Russian access to Kazakhstan has been blockaded, and the Republic of Kazakhstan under the presidency of Altay Amanzhol has been declared!

Where the hell had it all gone so wrong? Was it when Shukshin had initially taken over the Federation, or was it even earlier? Yet he also told himself that it didn't matter. Mistakes or no, they had to live with the consequences and try and fix whatever they could.\n\nAlexander stood up from his desk and walked over to the Presidential portrait of his late friend.

 NOV_failure.16.desc:0 ""What do you mean Shukshin was arrested? What the hell happened!" Alexander demanded with fury.\n\n"Shukshin was a threat to everything we built, Alexander," Glinka replied calmly. "His idealism would have doomed the Federation like it had the CSR. You should be thanking me. You're the President once more, my old friend. Things can finally go back to the way it was before this Reformist nonsense"\n\n"Thankful? General, this is treasonous! This cannot stand, I'm ordering you to release him immediately, General!" Pokryshkin ordered with as much venom in his voice as he could muster.\n\n"If you so much as try to see him, we'll shoot the bastard," the General replied coldly, his disobedience stunning the Aviator.\n\n"Y-you wouldn't. You can't!" Alexander exclaimed, his face contorted in anger and shock.\n\n"We will, Alexander. Now, you will do whatever the hell we tell you to do or he'll be the one to pay for it. You might be the President, Pokyshkin. But we're the ones in charge now. You better stay in line," Glinka threatened, "or else he'll die. Now, your inauguration is tomorrow. I suggest you show up on time," Glinka suggested before exiting the office, leaving Pokryshkin alone.\n\nAlexander collapsed into his chair as he held his head in his hands. The Siloviki. His own party! They have essentially kidnapped his best friend and have turned Vasily into a bargaining chip so they solidify their control over him. Alexander felt like vomiting, he couldn't believe what was happening. His head fell into his hands as he found himself repeating three words over and over."

 NOV_failure.17.desc:0 "Chulkov's advisor entered the room holding a large stack of folders which he promptly dropped on his boss's desk. "Here's the update on our current situation that you asked for," the advisor began. "To put it bluntly, doesn't look good, General Secretariat."\n\n"Might not look good, but it's all problems we can counter, comrade." Chulkov said as he picked up a folder and inspected it. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his advisor looking around the room, with particular interest on a certain picture frame. It showed a young man, no older than 30, in a white naval outfit with a peaked cap and the hammer and sickle stamped proudly on it. A smile of pure confidence painted his face.\n\nThe advisor pointed to the picture frame. "Who is this?" He asked, turning back towards his boss.\n\nChulkov looked at him with a faint smile. "Ah, my friend. He was a hero of the people," Chulkov explained. "I was under his command many years ago. He was a personal idol to me! He led Buryatia through the worst of times."\n\nThe advisor turned his head, confused. "Sounds like a great man," He asked. "Why isn't he here today?" He saw Chulkov's face immediately turn into a frown. The advisor's eyes widened, noticing the downcast look.\n\n"Well," Chulkov answered, "he's 6 feet underground. That's all I'll tell you. But," Chulkov said as he put his hand on the advisor's shoulder, "I'm sure he'd be looking down from the heavens proud at our glorious revolution! Now, we must immediately start working towards making our worker's paradise in the Far East, and one day reclaim Russia one by one!"\n\nDespite his outward confidence, Chulkov couldn't shake his strong sense of doubt that had nestled itself deep within him. He sometimes believed he was weak. He was scared of his legacy, and he was scared of the future. Would he be treated as a traitor for backstabbing Russia while it declined, or would he be seen as a hero of the revolution?"

#Duma Bill Loc
NOV_bill.1.t: "The Representation Act Passes!"
NOV_bill.1.desc: "Democracy is built upon the will of the people, and this cannot be expressed solely through the executive office. For it to survive, it must guide the government and be unhindered by unelected policymakers, and this is exactly what our new government has accomplished.\n\nIn a monumental vote within the Duma, the first piece of major legislation since the start of President Shukshin's administration has passed handily through the government. With an end to state-appointed deputies within the Federal Assembly, the Silovik stranglehold on our nation is foundationally checked for the first time since the Federation's birth. Our Duma has been utterly transformed, now elected by the people and run with their interests placed first. It cannot be said this bill ends our work removing the influence of the Siloviki of course, but with it comes the assurance the President's work cannot be so easily undone should he lose in coming elections.\n\nAs a consequence of our victory, the Federation has already begun to see renewed political expression on a scale not seen for decades. New parties and groups already fill the halls of government from all walks of the ideological spectrum. The days of a one party state and a regulated opposition will never return, as in its place stands a pluralist and free political system, shaping the nation's future forevermore."
NOV_bill.1.a: "One bill down, so many more to go."

NOV_bill.2.t: "The Voting Rights Act Passes!"
NOV_bill.2.desc: "Jubilant celebrations and muted protests have broken out all across the Federation as Vasily Shukshin yet again pushes his increasingly-idealistic vision of Russian democracy forward.\n\nAimed at targeting Silvoki-enforced electoral restrictions stretching back to the dissolution of the CSR, the Voting Rights Act is yet another step forward in the goal of unraveling the corporate state propagated under the former President. Polling stations will be administered locally, no longer under the "required protection" of arms. Minorities, Socialists, and other previously-deemed "security risks" under the Anti-Narodnik laws will be whitelisted from search, and save for already-convicted felons and criminals, all will be granted participation in their natural birthright to vote.\n\nThe VRPP may contest us on the grounds of "elective overreach" and "jeopardizing electoral integrity", but there will be no great reversal. Vasily Shukshin has put pen to paper, and his next chapter has only just begun."
NOV_bill.2.a: "For as long as the Writer holds the keys, the Russian Phoenix will burn brighter."
NOV_bill_2_tt: "§RThe ARPP will continue to radicalize!§"

NOV_bill.3.t: "The Fight for Civil Rights Triumphant!"
NOV_bill.3.desc: "A nation cannot reach its fullest potential when hampered and impeded by antiquated social norms, especially ones which would disempower and limit half its population. Today, our Federation has started the process of escaping such social strangleholds, and the women of Russia can finally begin to breathe free.\n\nOur recent legislation aimed at ending unequal treatment for women has been firmly passed into law by the Duma with the help of our coalition. New programs and regulations to end discrimination in the schoolhouse, workplace, and government office will be implemented across the Federation in short order. Such a shift in social norms cannot happen overnight, but with strict enforcement of the new law significant change is likely to be seen over the coming months, setting the Federation on a path towards more equal treatment of its people.\n\nOf course, this may go over less than smoothly with Russia's more conservative constituents, but our success provides a major boost to the President's popularity among the more progressive-minded, most of all the women of the Federation. For better or worse, the direction of the nation has been set firmly towards that of further equity, with no signs of stopping."
NOV_bill.3.a: "A boon to the march of progress!"

NOV_bill.4.t: "The Environmental Protection Act Passes!"
NOV_bill.4.desc: "Russia's natural beauty surpasses any other, from the lush greenery of its taigas to the snow-capped peaks of its mountains and its flowing rivers; however, since the megacorporations of the Federation first gained their power smog and pollution have laid waste to the environment. The Duma has finally acted on this injustice and taken a major step to see it end.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiation and President Shukshin personally pressing the issue, the Environmental Protection Act was finally signed into law. Strong regulations on industrial waste products, air pollution, and clean water will finally check corporate destruction of nature across the Federation. There is still much to be done in saving the natural beauty of the Federation, but a major victory has been won for the country and the President, a strong advocate of environmental regulation since the earliest days of his government.\n\nThe EPA has already received resounding approval from the public, even among more conservative voters, giving our government a strong mandate to enforce its provisions strictly. The VRPP has expressed its discontent with the harsh restrictions imposed by the legislation, but with such strong public support the Siloviki have remained quieter than usual. All in all, a great success has been achieved as the Federation begins to breathe freely once again."
NOV_bill.4.a: "May the waters of the Ob sparkle again, now and forevermore."

NOV_bill.5.t: "The Environmental Protection Act Repealed!"
NOV_bill.5.desc: "Idealistic Liberalism has no place in the heart of Russia. This lesson must be taught carefully, one step at a time. Vasily Shukshin's violent campaign of de-corporatization and "protection" of the Federation's "natural beauty" has severely affected not just our profit margins, but our image among society as a whole.\n\nThe VRPP only has Russia's best interests in mind. The youth, pliable as they are, have been molded by corrupt, disingenuous propaganda aimed at destroying everything Mr. Pokryshkin achieved during his great tenure in office.\n\nThe "Environmental Protection Act" is a thinly-veiled attempt at curtailing our ruthless ambition through stagnant bureaucracy, and in the Land of the Strong there is no room for such restrictive, harmful and anti-corporate measures. While thousands have already taken to the streets in mindless "protests", we will not be victims of intimidation. President Primakov will shed the Federation of liberal corruption one step at a time, with, or without Russia's consent."
NOV_bill.5.a: "The chains of regulation will be broken in due time."
NOV_bill_5_tt: "§RThe road to the Rubicon begins with a single step§"

NOV_bill.6.t: "The Corporate Limitation Act Passes!"
NOV_bill.6.desc: "The megacorporations of the Federation have strangled its economy and hindered free enterprise since the very start of Pokryshkin's presidency. They have corrupted our government and controlled our people for the sake of greed and power at all costs. Today, that era is behind us. The Federation has faced its economic jailwardens and made a resolute decree: No more.\n\nIn a revolutionary vote with the help of the whole of our coalition, the Federal Assembly has passed the Corporate Limitation Act into law, issuing comprehensive and widespread regulation targeting monopolies and corporate overstep. The bill includes several provisions against Feniks and Titan directly, as well as less harsh restrictions on Sibir, all aimed at freeing the market and allowing businesses outside the corporate sphere of influence to prosper and grow without being unfairly run out of the economy.\n\nThe vast majority of our voter base has celebrated the bill with overwhelming enthusiasm, especially among the small business owners of Russia and those most fervently against corporate control. The VRPP has expressed its dissatisfaction, of course, but with such non-partisan support for the bill, its passing proved to be inevitable. Today marks a turning point in Russia's history, with the oligarchy of the past left behind in place of a free and prosperous economy."
NOV_bill.6.a: "A toast is in order!"

NOV_bill.7.t: "The Worker's Protection Act Passes!"
NOV_bill.7.desc: "The greatest vice of Pokryshkin's administration was undeniably its cold and inhumane treatment of the common worker. Long hours and horrible conditions were all too common, all for the sake of corporate profits. Its human impact was almost incalculable, especially with the extremism and violence of the Narodniks, which could only have been fostered under such conditions. These laws intended to keep the Federation strong did nothing but make it suffer, but today the President has begun to heal the scars inflicted on the nation.\n\nAfter a long voting session, the Federal Assembly has passed the Worker's Protection Act, including sweeping and monumental reforms to the workplace across Russia. A stronger minimum wage, protections for unions, and improved workplace safety all were mandated in one of the largest pieces of legislation since the start of Shukshin's presidency.\n\nRussia has broken out into celebration and praise of the bill, with non-partisan support from across the whole of the nation. Likewise, the governing coalition has shared a rare moment of true unity and common triumph over the Act's passing, while the VRPP remains almost entirely silent as it doesn't dare to anger such a large portion of its voting base. The worker has won a great victory, but certainly not the last."
NOV_bill.7.a: "The common man rests soundly protected, and we our their shield."

NOV_bill.8.t: "The Universal Coverage Amendment Adopted!"
NOV_bill.8.desc: "The people's health is a fickle thing, especially in the hands of those that seek to squeeze every last dime from their pockets as they cry out for aid. The Federation's corporate-dominated healthcare system has harmed its people for decades, but today that legacy taints our government no longer.\n\nAfter a tense series of discussions with the Siloviki of the VRPP, the Federal Assembly has passed our jointly-authored constitutional amendment. The newly mandated policy includes a strong and robust national healthcare system for treating the most pressing and dire diseases and illnesses, but maintains a regulated private system outside such circumstances. A new public sector has already begun to be established as the existing private system adapts to its newly limited area of control.\n\nResponse to the legislation has been somewhat mixed, with supporters of the DSPR calling the amendment not nearly enough to fix the Federation's previously broken healthcare system, and some in the VRPP decrying it as still too extreme. The public is broadly approving of the amendment, importantly among conservatives as the budget remains in a far more reasonable position compared to what the proposals of the DSPR would have pushed it to. Like any compromise, no one is entirely pleased, but the Federation is undoubtedly in a much safer and healthier place."
NOV_bill.8.a: "Poggers"

NOV_bill.9.t: "The Universal Coverage Amendment Adopted!"
NOV_bill.9.desc: "The people's health is a fickle thing, especially in the hands of those that seek to squeeze every last dime from their pockets as they cry out for aid. The Federation's corporate-dominated healthcare system has harmed its people for decades, but today that legacy taints our government no longer.\n\nAfter a series of compromises and negotiations within our coalition, our joint constitutional amendment with Leonid Kantorovich's Democratic Socialists has finally been passed by the Federal Assembly. With its adoption, a robust national healthcare system, free of corporate influence or greed, is now mandated by the highest law of the Federation. Private insurance and any corporate power over the nation's well being is all but defunct as coverage extends to the vast majority of healthcare costs.\n\nA large share of our voter base has celebrated the success of the legislation, along with the supporters of the DSPR, but the amendment has proved to be divisive among the more conservative in Russia. The cost of such a wide-reaching system is no doubt high, but the full effect of the amendment on the budget will likely not be seen for some time. Nonetheless, the monetary cost cannot outweigh the human cost of inaction, and the Federation will recognize this as the benefits of the new system reveal themselves to the public."
NOV_bill.9.a: "No price is too high for human life."

NOV_bill.10.t: "The Federal Insurance Act Passes!"
NOV_bill.10.desc: "In the early days of President Shukshin's first term in office, the RAPP reached an agreement to pass a sweeping constitutional amendment instituting a national healthcare system; however, in the years since, it's become clear this legislation, while important and deeply beneficial to the Federation's people, did not go nearly far enough. Many Russians still failed to receive adequate medical aid, particularly in regions lacking the infrastructure to support it, but today this has begun to be remedied.\n\nThe Federal Assembly has resoundingly passed the President's new Federal Insurance Act, giving Russia a renewed budget for the public healthcare sector and increased coverage for underlooked areas like dentistry and optometry. Rural medical infrastructure has also seen a major boost, helping to increase access to pre-existing aid and better the lives of the Federation's most underlooked sick and poor.\n\nThe public and opposition within the Duma has generally approved of the bill, if more mutedly than some of our previous legislation, albeit with rural areas seeing a stronger reception. While by no means revolutionary, a significant flaw in the Federation's healthcare system has been mended, and the country continues to prosper."
NOV_bill.10.a: "Mending a past oversight."

NOV_bill.11.t: "Faltering Dreams"
NOV_bill.11.desc: "Despite our best efforts at rallying support for President Shukshin's latest piece of legislation, it seems we vastly underestimated the opposition waiting across the aisle.\n\nStuck in electoral gridlock for weeks, we failed to garner enough support in the chamber to secure our Act's passage. Despite attempting to align with smaller independent groups and organizations, a wall of fierce resistance from both extremes of the Duma whittled down our alliance vote-by-vote, stymieing any hopes of a clear majority through ruthless, yet effective legislative politicking.\n\nThis setback has substantially reduced our population's faith in the RAPP's grandiose dreams, driving support towards opposition parties on both ends of the political extreme. While this isn't a fatal blow for President Shukshin's administration, it will take a significant effort to restore Russia's trust in his vision for the future."
NOV_bill.11.a: "In times like these, I wish I could resort to Pokryshkin's methods."

NOV_bill.12.t: "Fading Strength"
NOV_bill.12.desc: "With the election of Yevgeny Primakov and the VRPP into power, millions across the Federation feared for the return of Pokryshkin's "Silvoki State". Cold, calculating, and most of all, uncaring, the Land of the Strong would rise once more from the pages of history and restore Russia to its rightful state: a nation of ruthless, untamed ambition.\n\nYet try as we might to tip the scales in our favor, Shukshin's political machine has grown into an empire of its own. Our failure to repeal the  Environmental Protection Act through democratic means is an untold embarrassment not seen since the election of Vasily.\n\nThe executives are angry, our support base is waning, and thousands of disgusting rioters now campaign on the streets for Primakov's removal from office. If we cannot reverse our fortunes through other, extra-juridical means, the President's vision for a Nation of Strength may end up just as Pokryshkin's folly did: History."
