 QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1:0 "Amidst a sea of hopelessess, Qinghai Province stands firm with the Free Chinese as the last bastion of Three Principles of the People and a China long gone. Ma Jiyuan, once just a general like any other warlords of the Republic now find his petty Qinghai suddenly the centre of the Resistance. However, there is a good reason why Ma never aspired to those goals of retaking the East. Stranded in an impoverished, illiterate and nomad province and drowning in internal disputes, Ma's situation is dire. But just like the Chinese word for crisis, in grave danger there are always oppertunities. Ma cannot afford a single failure, for himself, for his family, for the people. \n\nFor all of China."

 ###BOG EVENT TEXTS###

 BOG_Victory_text:0 "Though our enemies are fierce and well trained, careful planning and coordinated strikes carried the day. With mutineers fleeing in dishonour and shame, [getEventNodeName] has been liberated by advancing Golmud militia with minimal casualty, who are already clearing the area house by house, rounding up suspects, and establishing barricades to fend off potential counterattacks. The people vividly cheer for our troops as they march in open streets relatively unscathed, showcasing our ability to overcome any challenge. [getEventNodeName] is now under coalition control.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] NRA troops were made casualty, while Ningxia rebels lost [?defender_damage_taken] men, either captured, maimed or killed."

 BOG_Draw_text:0 "Though our enemies are fierce and well trained, the sheer determination of our citizens was able to equally match Ningxia soldiers.\n\nHowever, as casualties start stacking, our commanders hastily called off the attack, hoping to regroup and pick a fight for another day. Inexperienced militia organised from volunteering citizens suffered considerably, though the rebels did not pull back without loss either. [getEventNodeName] remains under Ningxia occupation.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] NRA troops were made casualty, while Ningxia rebels lost [?defender_damage_taken] men, either captured, maimed or killed."

 BOG_Defeat_text:0 "Despite our efforts, it seems the superior training of Ningxia Ma Clique won them the day. With our forces already withdrawing, the battle saw dozens losing their life, us taking significant casualties. Though we have the superiority in support and manpower, we must not needlessly assault enemy positions. [getEventNodeName] remains under Ningxia occupation.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] NRA troops were made casualty, while Ningxia rebels lost [?defender_damage_taken] men, either captured, maimed or killed."
 
 BOG_Decisive_Defeat_text:0 "Despite our efforts, it seems the superior training of Ningxia Ma Clique won them the day. With our forces already withdrawing, the battle saw many losing their life, us taking heavy casualties. Though we have the superiority in support and manpower, we cannot throw our forces into well-prepared kill zones, lest we lose both men and land to the filthy rebels. [getEventNodeName] remains under Ningxia occupation.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] NRA troops were made casualty, while Ningxia rebels lost [?defender_damage_taken] men, either captured, maimed or killed."
 
 BOG_Decisive_Victory_text_2:0 "With mutineers fleeing in dishonour and shame, their futile attempt of taking over [getEventNodeName] failed miserably. Many insurgent corpses scattered across the streets, laying open-air as reminders to those unfaithful. Though we are still cleaning up the battlefield, it is safe to say the Ningxia offensive in this area failed, and they are unlikely to commit another assault anytime soon. [getEventNodeName] remains in the hands of the coalition.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] Ningxia troops were killed, while our citizen militia lost [?defender_damage_taken] men."
 
 BOG_Victory_text_2:0 "With mutineers fleeing in dishonour and shame, their futile attempt of taking over [getEventNodeName] failed. Both sides suffered casualties, but it is evident Ningxia lost more heads to the defenders. Though we are still cleaning up the battlefield, it is safe to say they are unlikely to commit another assault anytime soon. [getEventNodeName] remains in the hands of the coalition.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] Ningxia troops were killed, while our citizen militia lost [?defender_damage_taken] men."
 
 BOG_Draw_text_2:0 "Though our enemies are fierce and well trained, the sheer determination of our citizens was able to equally match Ningxia soldiers. Their relentless attack on our position proved fruitless before they hastily called off the attack, sounding their gong as rebels retreat to where they came from. However, it would be ignorant to conclude the skirmish without mentioning the valiant defenders. The great pressure they bore and Chinese blood spilled for th efinal victory must not be forgotten. [getEventNodeName] remains under coalition control.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] Ningxia troops were killed, while our citizen militia lost [?defender_damage_taken] men."
 
 BOG_Defeat_text_2:0 "Despite our efforts, it seems the superior training of Ningxia Ma Clique won them the day. With our forces already withdrawing, the battle saw many losing their life, us taking heavy casualties. Plans and barricades all came to nothing when Ningxia forces were able to identify a weak spot in our defences, which was well-exploited, forcing the withdrawal of the defenders. Already rumours are spreading of 'total defeat'! [getEventNodeName] is now under Ningxia occupation.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?attacker_damage_taken] Ningxia troops were killed, while our citizen militia lost [?defender_damage_taken] men."
 
 BOG_Decisive_Defeat_text_2:0 "Despite our efforts, it seems the superior training of Ningxia Ma Clique won them the day. With our forces already withdrawing, today will be remembered as a dark episode of Chinese history as our forces are decimated by Ningxia maneuvres, taking advantage of the narrows, webbed streets to surprise our defender from the rear, causing massive casualties to our forces in the area. Already some are questioning our ability to defeat the rebels! [getEventNodeName] is now under Ningxia occupation.\n\nIn the recently concluded battle, [?defender_damage_taken] Ningxia troops were killed, while our citizen militia lost [?attacker_damage_taken] men."
 
 BOG_Capture_text:0 "Our troops anticipated at least some resistance, but it turns out nights of planning done by our staff to assault [getEventNodeName] turned out useless, at least for now. However, this could well be bait from our opponent to lure us into a false sense of security. Our troops are already reinforcing the tactical objective with sandbags and mapping out the surrounding."

 BOG_Enemy_Capture_text:0 "Whether by mistake or design, [getEventNodeName] has been taken by Ningxia forces with no resistance! Even if it was set as a diversion to keep Ningxia troops occupied with other things, our morale would nonetheless take a hit, and our control in the region weakened."

 QIN_In_the_Mountains_desc:0 "Fearless are the Free Chinese who survive among the great Qilian Mountains. Resourceful are the men who restlessly patrol the borderless Qaidam. Qinghai's harsh environment offers the inhabitants no mercy, yet it is also a fertile cradle of resilient troops. Decades of conflict hardened the exiles and equipped them with the necessary knowledge to fight efficiently in various terrains."
 
 QIN_Muslim_Superiority:0 "Issue of the Hui"
 QIN_Muslim_Superiority_desc:0 "Qinghai is not necessarily dominated by followers of the Prophet. Instead, it is a land of great religious diversity since the middle ages, with Taoists, Buddhists and Muslims that coexisted largely peacefully save for temporary upheavals. During the Tongzhi rebellion, the Hui (Ethnic and cultural Chinese who follow Islam) generals of Ma Zhan'Ao and Ma Haiyan established control over Qinghai, Ningxia and Gansu through defecting to the Qing. \n\nAlmost a century has passed since Muslim Hui generals and his men on horses proclaimed lordship over these lands, but it is more fractured than ever. Chinese refugee influx during the 1940s and 50s has changed local demographics significantly, creating tensions. \n\nIn addition, having fought the Japanese years after years for a people from distancing provinces, the largely Muslim cavalry of Ma Clique is growing ever wary of their unequal contribution and is questioning if the blood they shed was worth it..."

Having been robbed of the relatively more productive Gansu and Ningxia provinces, the loyalists found themselves cornered into lands utterly inhospitable. Many have sworn fanatic allegiance to the White Sun, yet their stomach remains empty. \n\nWorse still, the only portion of Qinghai yet agriculturally productive is right on the border between us and a living hell. We cannot afford to waste any resources on wars, lest our people starve!"

 Thirty_One_Years_of_Defiance_desc:0 "Since time immemorable for many China has been at war. For decades past China has known no peace. Since the new century, China knows only humiliation, defeat, warlordism and province by province, our motherland is lost to the Japanese devil and their blindly faithful dogs. \n\nIronically, it is now the duty of yet another warlord to bring salvation upon this damned land. Qinghai must not fail, lest the White Sun truly sets over this five-thousand-year-old civilisation."

 Year_of_Tiger:0 "The Year of Tiger"
 Year_of_Tiger_desc:0 "The Year of Renyin, or Water Tiger is upon us. Although Qinghai is quite Muslim, the Hui people still celebrate this holiday along with everyone else. With the uneasy peace achieved on the southern borders, many are saying that things will turn well for China, that in the next ten years with water as the Celestial Stem, the Chinese with this divine water will extinguish the Japanese sun in due time. \n\nWe can use this sentiment to rally much-needed support from locals with a few rousing speeches!"
 Rouse_the_soldiers:0 "Rouse the Soldiers"
 Rouse_the_soldiers_desc:0 "One key reason why we cannot match the Japanese is the morale of our troops. Of course, who would be willing to fight if all of our soldiers are peasants dragged out from their villages unwillingly, while underpaid, malnourished and expected to hold enemies back with little training and archaic rifle. This old concept of beating the enemy with sheer number must adjust itself to modern warfare. \n\nSure, Nationalism would serve as a great motivator, but it is not enough. What every man does recognise are hard cash and food. We'd rather have a small but effective and well-paid force rather than a million untrained rabble!"
 Rally_the_people:0 "Rally the People"
 Rally_the_people_desc:0 "For a country as vast as China, there is no surprise that regionalism sometimes overrides the concept of a national state. This is especially true for China, however, as unlike European states of old, Chinese provinces lack communication between them even decades after Industrial Revolution, thus creating cultural and dialect boundaries that make it hard for someone in the Northwest to care about what is happening in the East when their life is already harsh enough. \n\nThis will have to change. We must embed the idea of China, an unified China into the people, only then can Qinghai realise its potential."
 Rebuild_the_industry:0 "Rebuild the Industry"
 Rebuild_the_industry_desc:0 "Cut off from all sides, we can no longer beg for external support. The aid must come from the hands of Qinghai. With the lack of heavy industry, however, it would be highly difficult to arm our men. \n\nDuring the Sino-Japanese wars, the shortage of domestic weapon production can be traced back to the lack of quality materials to supply the workers and machinery. The great armouries of Hanyang and Taiyuan could have produced millions of rifles if a stable source of raw material and funds can be directed towards production.\n\nThis will ensure this time an efficient and effective system of production will be set up around the city of Xining, and prepare for future expansion onto the heavy industry."
 Stability_a_priority:0 "Stability A Priority"
 Stability_a_priority_desc:0 "Qinghai is a highly diverse region since the rise of the Chinese and Tibetan empires. Various settlements of different ethnicities dot the plateau, creating new challenges for old administrations. Pushing around modern reforms must be calculated with every step we make, as they inevitably come at the cost of locals. We must now look into controlling Qinghai and other lands in the future, to ensure a stable foundation may be struck for the great building that is Chinese Unification. \n\n§GYou can access the management interface via the 'Political' window. This is an important aspect of you steering Qinghai Province to modernisation. Gameplay-wise, You will need to balance stakes to help you integrate territories, construct buildings and modernise Northwest China! Do not be overwhelmed, though, as the initial gameplay will introduce this mechanics.§!"
 Food_problem:0 "Food Problem"
 Food_problem_desc: "Long has the spectre of famine loomed over China, and in Qinghai, there are no exceptions. In a province of high mountains and arid desert, we can allocate little land to producing food. The food is running low, lower than ever. If we are to do anything, this is the first order of business."
 Literacy_issue:0 "Literacy Issue"
 Literacy_issue_desc:0 "China is an illiterate state, and there is little we can do to cover this fact. While literacy has raised dramatically in the West as well as Japan during the early 20th century, in China this only extends to a handful cities on the coast, which are now all flying the flag of the Rising Sun. One would be foolishly optimistic to say even one man out of ten in Qinghai can understand Chinese. Literacy is long considered to be an indicator of how modern countries are, and so we shall allocate a massive amount of resources towards education."
 Calculate_the_rations:0 "Calculate the Rations"
 Calculate_the_rations_desc:0 "Statistics have shown that Golmud Government may not be using food and other commodities effectively. Some regions like Xining suffer food shortages while having too many commodities with no one to buy them. A thorough investigation will be launched to adjust our policies towards satisfying the basic needs only through calculations, giving the people just enough to keep them alive before we can find other sources of food. \n\nWaste not, want not. Only thin streams flow for long."
 Omnipresent_grip:0 "Omnipresent Grip"
 Omnipresent_grip_desc:0 "What is regrettable is not that we have too little, but that we have no clue where food is being produced and to whom are they sent. Having carried over the old Kuomintang government's tradition of relative autonomy, there is little oversight over farms. Some may call it to overreach or even unjust to forcibly dictate what to produce and what price must the goods be sold. It is. It is the necessary evil we must take. \n\nHopefully this process can go smoothly without too much resistance..."
 Proliferate_winter_schools:0 "Proliferate Winter Schools"
 Proliferate_winter_schools_desc:0 "Winter School is the practice whereby peasants learn about writing and reading Chinese during the winter season when they have the most available time to take in knowledge. Originally implemented by the Communists, it has also been adopted by the Nationalists in their territories. For the sake of sweeping away illiteracy, winder schools must extend beyond winters and forcibly be adopted to all villages in Qinghai. Though it may appear rushed as the food problem is nowhere near gone and we are already demanding more from the people, helping peasants recognise the Chinese would also allow modern agricultural practices to be communicated and spread by the villagers themselves. It would only ease their life, too!"
 Shortcut_to_literacy:0 "Shortcut to Literacy"
 Shortcut_to_literacy_desc:0 "Ancient Chinese insists that in the sea of learning, pain is the only boat that fares people between the shores of ignorance and enlightenment. Qi Jianhua will show modern problems can be dealt with with modern techniques. A young Communist official co-administrating villages around Golmud with KMT ones, Qi claims he has found the long-awaited solution to mass illiteracy. Using a three-stepped approach to learning Chinese characters, results coming out from areas where schooling is an alien concept can only be described as miraculous. We will invite Qi to demonstrate his methods to all educators of Golmud..."
 
 Study_the_southwest_model:0 "Study the Southwest Model"
 Study_the_southwest_model_desc:0 "Terrace farming on hills throughout southern China, as well as Southeastern Asia, is a tradition embedded into farming practices, yet it is absent in the steep hills of Qinghai. Many rivers originate here in the mountains, feeding lush valleys which remain unusable for agriculture due to terrain. If we are to study how terrace farming can be transplanted from the hills of Yunnan and Guizhou to Qinghai, it would be certain to improve food insecurity."
 Make_example_in_the_military:0 "Make Example in the Military"
 Make_example_in_the_military_desc:0 "The army, be they controlled by the Kuomintang or the Communists, are an aspect of the society looked upon with respect by local people as their protector. Launching a literacy campaign in the military would most definitely aspire the civilian to follow suit. \n\nMoreover, professionalism as well as the overall image of the army can also be improved. Qinghai's men are often thought to be 'uncivilised' compared to those of the Ningxia Ma Clique who are mandated to be literate before joining the army and also happen to have better discipline and attitude towards local people. We must look up to them."
 Discussion_of_land_reform:0 "Discussion of Land Reform"
 Discussion_of_land_reform_desc:0 "Land reform has always been the elephant in the room for China. From local bureaucrats to higher-ups, it is widely understood that the inefficient system of land ownership in villages and towns is the key reason why China cannot modernise like Japan. Of course, local elites would be opposed to such changes in the slightest, so the reform would have to take stages. \n\nFirst, serfs across Qinghai have been obligated to pay landlords an outrageous portion of their earnings that their life is nothing short of misery. By adjusting this, we can reduce their workload but allow them to have access to more resources to increase production even further. \n\nThe second stage involves selling government-owned land to peasants and offering a loan program to those without land. Peasants owning more land in proportion to landlords would certainly negate the latter's power and make everything easier. \n\nWhen the right time comes, we will dismantle preexisting land ownership arrangements by forcibly purchasing lands of rich landlords and redistributing them to the peasantry. The Communists are more than happy to cooperate with us on this matter, a rare occurrence that must be well exploited."

Although much of China still remained outside of Nanjing's control or straight up defiant, Chiang Kai-shek gave the nation a unified purpose first envisioned by Dr Sun.\n\nNow, the third revolution is coming to the Republic of China. Chen Lifu of the Central Club recognises the weakness that led to Kuomintang's defeat. The party has been all but too fractured and disloyal, countering the central authority whenever possible.

It took Chiang but ten years to transform China from a backward and chaotic state into a nation that has the will to resist until the very end. When the westerners easily gave up and signed treaties, the Chinese, under the command of the Generalissimo, dealt perhaps more casualties to the Japanese than all of the west ever did.\n\nNow, his son stands forth.

After all, according to Xunzheng, these hard times require strongmen to guide China out of misery and barbarism.\n\nThe liberals understand that authoritarianism is no longer an optimal model for Qinghai and China. So many argued and discussed why the Kuomintang failed, and yet they all conveniently ignored the true issue. How can China revitalise, if it is placed under the jackboots of corrupt oligarchs and military despots?  Look at the prosperous States and their allies!

After so much hardship and sacrifices, the Chinese People, in their holy and just war against Fascist invaders have passed through the absolute bottom of the War. The hour in which the Chinese People, together with our friends in India, in America and everywhere that still fights on counterassault the German-Japanese Axis of Evil is drawing closer by the years, by the months, by the weeks and by the days. And yet, China still remains disunited, and free, unconquered China still remains in crisis. Under these kinds of circumstances, what ought we do?\n\nComrades, I think the answer is all but too obvious. China is in dire need to unite all of her parties and independent figures into one, democratic, temporarily united government, in order to push through democratic reforms, overcome current challenges, mobilise and unify all anti-Japanese forces in China to aid the Allied Powers in defeating the Japanese invaders and liberate all of China from their yoke. After which, based on the foundations of democracy, a national representative congress shall be opened, and transform the temporary government into one that includes an even wider array of political groups and individuals, to guide the liberated peoples of China together and to forge the nation into an independent, free, democratic, united and prosperous power, one that will not only defend China but of Asia and the world in countering Fascists of Asia, Europe and Africa. To sum it up, the doctrine shall be that of tolerance and unity, defeating the invaders and rebuilding the country.\n\nWe believe that only the path of unity and acceptance reflects the true demands and agendas of the Chinese people. And therefore my report shall be mainly concerned with these points. The Chinese people and the Allied Powers have begun to increasingly question whether China should establish a united government and its details, and I hope what I report shall answer most if not all of them accordingly.\n\nThroughout the Thirty-one Years' War of Resistance, the works of the Communist Party of China have overcome a myriad of challenges and difficulties, and through our effort, Qinghai and Xikang were preserved from the Imperialist Japanese. However, even in this hour, there are roadblocks that won't be going anywhere soon.

However, up until this point, there hasn't been a real attempt to organise them into a proper collection of books, as hundreds of thinkers produced a great amount of work. To organise it in Qinghai would not be so different from Emperor Kangxi's attempt to catalogue everything on the face of Earth. \n\nHowever, it would be critical for us to educate our younger generation about the history and development of doctrines and ideologies.\n\nIn addition, it can also come to our aid. Though we won't be pointing fingers so quickly, we can organise and 'edit' the works in such a way that we catalogue Mao Zedong and Comrade Gao Gang's works together, while placing those of Liu with Wang Ming and Bo Gu in order to delegitimise him."

The term in China was used against the Trotskyist clique of Chen Duxiu that separated from the Party. Now, many are drawing parallels between Liu Shaoqi and Trotsky and Chen Duxiu's actions that brew factionalism and sought compromises.

By purchasing the lands fairly from the landlords, the state would bring about to gradually shift the land ownership to small, independent farmers who will be aided by the State to buy out the rich. Since Qinghai itself has been more or less transformed, these policies would only prove critical when we are to reorganise territories beyond Qinghai. "

And since Confucianism argues for a heavily stratocratic structure by comparing a state to a family, the Republic is highly gerontocratic, not unlike the Comitia of the Roman Republic.

Defining Xing or practice as a universal, constantly occurring phenomenon, Chiang advocates that almost any given action can be categorised into Xing. Unlike Wang Yangming of the Ming Dynasty, Chiang heavily emphasises action, perhaps out of the idleness of the Kuomintang then.

 tmm.maclique.1.d:0 "The Ma Clique are some of the most influential warlords of the old Republic of China, dominating the desert landscape covering Qinghai, Ningxia and Gansu well before the birth of the Republic itself. During Chiang's de facto control of China, Ma cliques resisted many attempts by external intruders with little to no heavy weapon, even defeating a Communist invasion in 1936. However, this relative independence was abruptly ended after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. \n\nThe Japanese came with their tanks, aircraft, and artilleries. The fight was vicious. Where the Japanese would bombard fortifications to dust, the Chinese, with no modern construction technology to speak of, reinforce them with our sheer will and determination. Where the Japanese would cross the great rivers and exploit the railways, the Chinese blew the dams and keep them at bay. But sacrifices were not enough. They paid with blood for every inch of land they took, but it was not enough. \n\nAfter the fall of Chongqing and the death of Chiang, the rest of China still untouched by the Japanese menace collapsed, and the little unity Kuomintang enjoyed swiftly reduced to renewed warlordism. The Japanese did not push any further into Qinghai but created a new, artificial Hui state to keep the rebels in check. Sensing this weakness, the Tibetans, armed both by the Japanese and the Calcutta regime launched invasions and seized the territory of Yushu, previously conquered by the infamous Ma Bufang.\n\nNow the time is 1962. Ma Jiyuan, son of Ma Bufang, have taken up the mantle as the leader of the Kuomintang in exile. His visions are grand but empty... \n\nUnless we can stabilise and take back what's rightfully ours."

Coming from the southern provinces feeding off the Yangtze, Qinghai is no place for their appetite, but at least the exiles would not end today half-hungry. \n\nChinese get-together dinners are often compared to battlefields, and in the inner circle of Golmud, this is no exception. The Nationalists and the Communists sit at different tables, and spy on each other to pin down the allies, the fence-sitters and the enemies in the upcoming storm. Both sides knew the internal divisions of the opposing party, and it is only the Japanese that is preventing open civil conflicts.  \n\nBut what the two parties can agree on is maintaining the facade of stability. \n\n'...A ray of hope is before China, but only if we reach for it!

This is the place he desired, a place he may rest, knowing the soothing sounds of wind shall calm his heart of revolution. \n\nForever. \n\nThere like the Emperors of a past age, he commissioned a tower half a dozen metres high, preparing for his ailing body. Then the Japanese came. Like an unstoppable wave, they marched. The Government moves West, every step a blow to Chinese confidence. They dared not inform him of the terrible bombings in his home province perpetrated by the Japanese in response to American air raids. Ironically his life would not be ended by the Japanese, but by a nameless American in a car crash. \n\nIt was thought that despite the harsh war, China and her allies would emerge victoriously, and the man may return to his Tower which Hides the Bones. But the fall of Chongqing finally made it clear that returning was not possible. His ashes were transported west on the road of retreat to Golmud, now a shrine of the exiled Nationalists.

Shepherds and nomads would cross it at will with their host of yaks snorting through, as their ancestors did for centuries. Though harsh with little entertainment to speak of, at least the garrison here can be left in peace. \n\nWhen the miserly sun finally sprayed rays of light upon the frozen valley, the Indians spot not the usual animals, but a convoy of men in the distance, in a single column not so different from marching ants. Rising their STEN and Lee-Enfields, the patrol advances to meet these strange intruders. \n\nOnly as they approached closer did the blindingly white sun fall beyond mountains and their adversaries face made visible.

During the war, Hu commanded the 1st Military Region, a battle-hardened, 400,000 men strong formation that fought from Shanghai to Xi'an. His grand army was the sole reason why the Northwest is not yet entirely lost, and it wouldn't be lost altogether if it wasn't for traitor Fu Zuoyi's sudden surrender of the 12th Military Region that led to the complete collapse of NRA in Shaanxi and Gansu. Whether a victor or not, China remembers Hu as a brave soldier and leader. \n\nGuarded by the 84th Division, the last of Hu's army, his casket is to be buried shallow outside of Golmud, for the old general wishes not to slumber anywhere but the hilly shores of Zhejiang. \n\nAs the 24 guns, facing east, salute thunderously to Hu Zongnan's death, Qinghai found itself still in the shadows of the old Kuomintang, and its decade-old struggle.

 tmm.maclique.12.d:0 "According to Section 17 of The 37.5% Arable Rent Reduction Act of the Republic of China, violence includes that of officials using an unnecessary amount of force and landowners are protected from abuses from officials as peasants are.\n\nMr. ZHAO Ziyang's case (43, Party affiliation: Communist Party of China, overseeing Dulan County) as the reason for this statutory interpretation will be listed as follows.\n\nOn 17th January, 41st year of the Republic, Dulan County issued orders independent of that of the Government on the matter of mandatory land ownership reformation in the local area, with widespread dissent from local Tibetan and Mongol aristocrats. Mr Zhao acted against the Constitution of the Republic of China Chapter XI Article 2 Section 119 and 120, stating the freedom of Mongol and Tibetan people of self-governance, and instead on 23rd January commanded Communist militias to assault aristocrat estates, causing 29 deaths and 19 injuries.

With his left hand holding the rein and his right hand his Mauser equally firm, the man slowed down ever so slightly, not because of the endless ocean of golden blooms around Dulan, but the unresting sand and gravel ahead, forming a dark tide on the horizon.\n\nHe'd heard from his colleagues that the Mongols want nothing short of his death, knowing the Golmud Government have effectively given up on any means of real punishment. He'd know they'd come for him. He slaughtered those reactionaries, maybe now it's his turn. If it is the hour, he would not die without bringing a few more reactionaries with him. But the God of War, perhaps having seen too much bloodshed these days or he is simply planning for an even bigger one somewhere else, left Zhao alive. It was the convoy of the new ruler of Dulan, Hu Qili and his men, with their red banner flying high.\n\n'Good to see you these days, young comrade. Now my task is done, I...I shall wish you safety there.'\n\nZhao paused a little. But for a determined Communist of course he had no fears for himself, only for his friend. With his actions, what would be the cost to Party's reputation, and Qili's work?\n\n'That wicked place is full of feudal dogs not wanting to give up their so-called birthrights by an inch. And the Nationalists ain't any better. You will have much to do, Comrade Hu.'\n\n'We have many tricks up our sleeves to deal with them, don't you worry. If they cooperate all is good, if they dare to come for you or us, my platoon will wash that river as red as our flag.'\n\nThe man sighed. Why does it have to be like this? Why on earth can't they understand socialism and work towards a righteous cause of equality? He dismantled his very own estates for distribution of land, but these Mongols seem to be doing the opposite.\n\n'Well that would be the last resort, comrade. The Party isn't exactly happy about the killings, you see, especially when they aren't Han. Ethnic unity and stuff. They are sending me for Golmud, I'd be in luck to not have my party member status stripped!'\n\nHu suddenly busted into laughter, much to Zhao's annoyance and confusion.

Allocated funds are running out and the progress is still slow.\n\nNRA 7th Security Regiment overseeing the region is stretched too thin for us to have proper security. And corruption too is making our job more than difficult. On paper, our garrison strength is roughly that of a company, but I observed at most thirty men at the barracks.

Combined with the occasional dust dancing around midair, anyone would have found peace. But the man and the grand portrait of the Generalissimo remain shrouded in darkness.\n\nHe's been through too much, he knows no fear in fight and death, but this is something way beyond it. Chinese philosophies have always favoured political and diplomatic maneuvers than conflict, and as such Qinghai is rife with them. He can shoot well enough, but political maneuvering? These are enemies immune to violence most of the time. Ma knows too little about the intrigue too late, and now he's stuck with one of the most complicated scenarios possible. \n\nHe leans forward ever so slightly, gazing down upon his aged vintage furniture, with his palm on his forehand.

All of this originated in the concept of Party-State, tying the Party to every aspect of the political landscape. And as such, Kuomintang membership became more or less a prerequisite for one's political career. Thus, it would be less surprising that the party is an enormous tent, and even within this tent smaller ones are struggling together.\n\nAnd since most of the old Kuomintang have either died out or surrendered, the mainstream Kuomintang is weakened severely, causing a surge in factionalism, with various leaders each holding to different plans how they would manage China. Their aspirations are now breaking the party apart, the Japs ironically being the only party maintaining the Kuomintang together.

However, for every such reformer in the party, there is one reactionary trying to undo everything. Most of them are lowly army officers, but they are, in the end, united by one figure, and he is none other than Dr Sun Yat Sen's very own son.\n\nSun Ke did not inherit the thinking of Dr Sun, but certainly the questionable methods he used to ascend to the leadership of China in the early days of the Revolution. Nor did he pick much about Democracy either - It's not like his father did a great job on building Chinese democracy, anyways. Sun Ke carefully utilized the anti-communist sentiment present in warlord and central forces, and appealed to their worst fear - Eventual centralisation and these so-called 'local emperors' loss of power to extract wealth however they pleased, and so expands his political faction - A coalition of marginal KMTs, suspicious of any reforms and thoroughly conservative."

The frantic westernisation by China and Japan copied everything, without hesitation. Both fallen to dictatorship, both damned to be ever shadowed by autocracy.\n\nAs Chongqing falls, the originally marginalised Xishan Conference Group reemerged as a powerful organisation of the Right, but this time, the conservatives are determined to avoid the mistakes. Surrounding Zhang Qun and other anti-Chiang government officials, the Neo-Xishan Group, consisting of all sorts of intellectuals understood one factor contributing to China's defeat - Its loss of morals. For too long have the leaders of China forgotten the virtues of old that brought ancient dynasties to glory. Too long have the Chinese grown numb to prejudice, violence and lack of belief. The New Life Movement tried to mend it, but unless a strong faith is restored, it is but pointless.\n\nOf course, they are not bound to simply imitate Confucius. His strict patriarchy among other questionable beliefs must go in this new age - the Chinese long understood to 'remove the rubbish and retain the wisdom', and the Xishan conservatives aim to combine ancient philosophies and modern ones, uniting the best parts of the two worlds. Under an informal pact with the CC clique, Kung and Soong families, it is an influential political club, wielding as much support as Chiang himself.\n\nThrough cooperation with Chiang, the Xishan Conference Group expanded its influence vastly, but what is more deadly and unnegotiable than even Qinghai politics is time itself. All born in the imperial era, many are on the doorstep of death. Just a few more years and the clique may just die out, not with a bang but a whimper."

Representing the highly liberal media of Qinghai, Lei's repeatedly calls, sometimes physically against hardliners, for the institution of civilian government in the Legislative Yuan so much he'd be given the nickname 'Battleship of Democracy'. Of course, Lei is clearly aware that the dreadnaught that is his movement is only stepping away from total annihilation by the mainstream, but his careful cooperation with the CCP and KMT kept Free China afloat to grow into one of the biggest non-government organisations in Qinghai, the great outlet of Zhengxuepai. \n\nAs neither side can afford the potential retaliation from the other side if they are to shut down the organisation, Free China found itself balancing one of the most uneasy relationships on the face of Earth.

Long considered the de facto opposition of China, the Communist Party is far more coherent and united than the fractured Nationalists. Despite the hardships they'd endured, the Communists overcame all challenges. The five encirclements, the long march, and the anti-Japanese war. Many loyal comrades were lost along the way, including the great leader Mao Zedong, but fortunately, the fires of the revolution remain lit, however weak and unspectacular it may seem.\n\nHowever, since the death of Mao Zedong, the CCP to is slipping towards the same problems the old Kuomintang faced. Whatever kind of person Mao was, he was able to tie the whole party together, and it seems none have been able to reach the same level of control and party unity as Mao once did. With Liu Shaoqi succeeding in Mao's position, his careful cooperation with the Kuomintang did not win too much affection in the party. Oppositions rose and by the 1960s, Liu was forced to secondary positions, with the younger Gao Gang reigning supreme.\n\nThe source of the conflict originates mostly in the two bureaus: The Northwest and the Northern China Bureaus, headed by Gao Gang and Liu Shaoqi respectively. Their conflicting agendas on the KMT, the economy and ethnic issues are slowly breaking the once-mighty Red Army apart.

Something else, something more precious occupies his estate.\n\nThe two walks in the east-facing room, filled to the maximum with Buddhist statues, ancient bronze and inkstone on terraced shelves against the walls. The collections are almost indistinguishable from each other, for most of the windows are blocked by calligraphy papers. With a single kerosene lamp flickering, the room is adorned with an unspeakable, mysterious aura not different from a Chinese legendarium.\n\n'Old Kang, one'd take you as a faithful Buddhist! With so many artefacts, no wonder why you'd never buy new clothes.' Deng expected something like this, but his eyes still cannot but give off surprise and adornment.\n\n'Ah, I don't like keeping money around or having a too materialistic life. Have to spend it somehow, you know. Ladies dream of dresses, men yearn for automobiles, I, Shengtan of the modern era love these above all else.' The workaholic that is Kang Sheng is usually emotionless most of the time, but through those glasses lightly fogged by breath, he sees a man eager to share, as if talking about his sons and daughters.\n\nDeng thoughtfully scans the presentation, intrigued. 'What's with the calligraphy though? I thought you loved the Treasures of the Study and sculptures. I always wondered if you, comrade Kang, being such an excellent letterer would refrain from taking in those.'\n\n'Maybe it's just me having a higher bit of standard. If I spot good ones, I'm not walking away without them. Speaking of this...'"
 tmm.maclique.28.d:0 "Gobi Desert isn't lifeless, it's only the opposite, yet men still find this land appalling. One can ride a thousand Lis and still find himself in the same landscape - Not that he's going in circles, but the sheer blandness of the Gobi. Yellowish, unhealthy bushes clutch together pathetically for precious water, and even the reptiles today chose to refuge under the xerophytes, waiting. Nothing moves, save for the lowly shrubs violently swaying to the Northwestern wind. All await the heat to pass, not Zheng Dongxin, not till his shifts end.\n\nA middle-aged man, Zheng is certainly used to the heat. Jiangnan's rainy summers are just as intolerable, but the Gobi was something else. He'd also fare a bit better if he wasn't alone. There are fewer men nowadays, and Ma Bufang's brutal conscription in the past kept most households closed to the armies even to this day. But alas, he is on one of the most important posts possible in Qinghai - Patrolling the borders. Just behind him stands the great Qilian, far more dominating than the hills of Zhejiang, yet barely alive. And on the other side lies Gansu to the East, or what remains of it. Sometimes he'd pick up a few stray families or so running from the Japanese, but recently the other side is growing ever silent. Reaching for his water bag, Zheng fights against thirst as the cold water rushes down his throat, and tries to not think of what's going on beyond Qinghai.\n\n'Old Zheng!'\n\nBefore he'd be done with drinking, a yell from behind caught the rider in surprise. Luckily for him, that was in the ancient speech of Wu.\n\n'You aren't supposed to be here!'\n\n'Shift's no more, we are needed elsewhere!'\n\nTucking his water bag back on that aged leather belt, Zheng steers his steed back, only to realise his fingers are still on his Zhongzheng's trigger."

Most, tired from work find propaganda only irritating and returned to slumber, but not its younglings. Following the radios, those with enough ration to still care about things beyond their life gathered on Zhongshan road, not long before a column of the army approached the main streets from the barracks towards the south. A mix of battered Russian ZIB-5s, war horses and an old Ford limousine make up this mishmash force. Their intention was mysterious, and their departure rushed. It is not till a soldier on the truck grabbed a megaphone and started speaking in his Northwestern accent.\n\n'Citizens of the Republic, today is not like any other! It is the day, we diplomats, of the National Government, depart to meet with Mr Liu Wenhui! Everyone, please do wish our men the best!'\n\nThe people, together with those peeking out their heads from the windows, joyfully cheers the men as they parade before their journey to the South, though some of them aren't even aware of who Liu Wenhui is. But to those refugees from the east, it is life-changing. Liu, the successor to General Xue Yue's legacy, the only other province still fighting the war. Too long have the two been separated by distance. If his support can be secured, then the Tibetans are nothing to fear.\n\n'Good luck to all of you! Long live the Republic of China!'\n\nThe representative in the limo isn't getting along with the excitement, though. He didn't sleep quite well.\n\n'Sir... would you like the windows shut?'

Mao'er Gai... or something like that, he couldn't be bothered. When the third-year strikes, he can rotate with the greens, and be with his family. In the last days of their service, even the commanders have been less strict lately.\n\n'Young Liu, the barrack's out of the water, you get some for the boys!'\n\nThe squad leader gave Liu several kettles and a Japanese helmet. Should have taken more care with the other kettle last time, Liu thought. 'Be there and back quickly, or our rice is gonna burn!' He has no problems with it, though. Better than fighting in trenches with the men in the east.\n\nWhen Liu An reached the old well in the village, a few NCOs, the commander and a dozen privates were already lining up for the precious water. Despite the numerous rivers running through Xikang, none of them can be properly utilised - Not because the quality is bad, but simply too hard to access. Two years ago when they'd lost a soldier to the river, the army strictly ordered them not to siphon water off the great arteries of China. It takes longer, but the superiors are all right with that - especially since soldiers get to talk to locals, and build up cohesion between the civilians and the army. Though this land is distant from their homes and the people speak a different language, over time the Tibetans have grown used to the Chinese presence, and are on good terms with the soldiery.\n\nThe villagers expected the daily routine, but what they did not anticipate are a few dozen officers flooding in from the mountainous path leading into the village, one of them, in his sixties even bears the order of the Sacred Tripod. Usually, the higher-ups wouldn't care about what's going on in an ordinary settlement, and if they do, something awful is going to happen. The villagers turned to the garrison, only to find Liu An and his comrades at attention in a straight line with their buckets on the ground.\n\nWeren't they chatting as if they were on leave seconds ago...? The sudden seriousness almost startled the residents, who are now retreating themselves against their cottages, spectating silently."

This will be the last time you gather water from this well. Me, the 137th and the Party-State expect the company to be combat-ready in thirty minutes. Gather your belongings, and meet up with the 7th Regiment at Songpan. You are to march either with or without the sun, you will receive further orders at Songpan. That is all.

He also noticed the lack of smoke that would otherwise be swirling into the blue sky around the kitchens at this moment.\n\n'Squadron leader, where the hell are we going?'\n\n'Didn't tell us much.

In Chinese armies, due to low literacy and supply issues, trucks are beheld more precious than gold, and as such the few who know how to operate them are even more rightfully. The giant half steel, the half wood machine is almost witchcraft to these shepherds' sons, who when encountering topics like combustion engines simply surrender. If it wasn't for them being genuinely good men, Yang'd be living in hell, with absolutely no one to talk about these majestic beasts.\n\nThe men stuffed themselves into the small cab, with the sides of the road barely visible. If it was back in Shanghai he'd most likely lose his license for this.\n\n'Now listen up folks, this is... well common sense, but I guess I'll need to explain to you a bit. This truck runs on a machine, and, um, it gets hotter the more it works. Think of... uh, kettles, yes. Kettles. You burn the hell out of it, and it might just blow up. And that's the reason we'd need a lot of water for the journey. Now next time I'd hope I don't need to fill the tanks up... Um, think of it like training.'\n\n'Old Yang!' Liang's voice is as feeble as men falling in quicksand, barely audible over all the engine noises.\n\n'Louder!'

The Sichuan basin, or at least the western part of it, reminds the fertile plains of the east. But Song isn't here for memories of home. If he wants to have time for that, he must pull this one off first - Getting Liu Wenhui closer to Qinghai.\n\nHe'd toured the venue multiple times by now, checking the number of enamel cups, chairs and pens. But being the kind of person that wouldn't sleep without two ticks on every to-do, the stress in his mind constantly reminds him... no, insists that something was missing. This isn't a situation where mistakes are tolerated. To soothe his thoughts, eventually, Song decided to take the initiative and fill the backside of the hall with a few dozen chairs.\n\nBefore the half-sweating representatives knew it, the clock struck eleven. Footsteps can be heard in the corridors. It is happening. He pulled out the script from his pocket, dashed towards the other men from Qinghai still talking, and gave their shoulders a light pat. The officials, as if electrocuted, rush themselves to the lectern.\n\nEnters the commander of the Ninth Military Region and chairman of Xikang Province, alongside military leaders, civilian representatives and bureaucrats, who proceed to take seats. The easiness of Liu contrasts sharply with that of Song's mind. Years of training, all come down to this moment...\n\n'Welcome, all citizens, soldiers, comrade students. Today we behold, as the Kuomintang Party Headquarters of Xikang formally enters use, alongside the first representative session of the Xikang section of the Nationalist Party.'\n\nSave for scribbling noises, there is naught but silence.

Staring into the sandy dunes of Gansu extending almost indefinitely, Wan almost felt pity for the Japanese, who'd have spent so much time in that scorched hell, if they didn't make a living off raiding civilians.\n\n'Commander Wan!' The breeze-accompanied peace was dramatically broken by the scout running in zig-zags along the narrow path leading into the camp.\n\n'What on earth, you little bastard? Can't give your fellows a moment of peace? On the bloody edge of neurasthenia here.' With his almost comedic Henan dialect, Wan looks disapprovingly of young Pan. Last time he'd alert the whole company over a bunch of stray sheep. But at least they tasted nice, he reckoned.\n\n'Sol, soldiers!' Without further words, the troops grabbed their rifles, some already loading their weapons.\n\n'Clarify yourself!'\n\n'The... the Japanese!' Pan tripped over himself on the rocky path. Wan and his men, now alert, quickly dragged him behind cover, giving him water and time to organise his thoughts 'Well I was thinking, we-we were low on rations, so I figured I'd visit that village and buy some lamb from that old Mehmet. I-I went to the Hui's place and found nothing but blackened bodies and smoke! I was scared and I encountered one of them...'\n\n'And you went straight back here witho-'\n\n'Charge!' Following a shout in Japanese are Japanese bullets raining on the covering stone, each hit shaking the hideout ever so slightly.

Maybe it is the terrifying mountains and the thousands of souls below withering in a foreign land, or perhaps self-imposed stress. When the aircraft crossed the Himalayas into the great flat plains of India, Wang most certainly relieved thoroughly, at least that's what the accompanying secretary noted down.\n\nWhen Wang woke up again to the turbulence, the minister rubbed his old glasses carefully against the bright beams of light now descending on Wang without the obstruction of cloud or snow. The old diplomat puts on his glasses and gazes down. He can see the Ganges, reflecting the sun back wholly, almost blinding him.\n\n'Such a river!' He thought, 'Nurturing so many for thousands of years, yet so impassable and so deadly.' Soon Wang found the reflection irritating to his sixty-year-old eyes. He quickly looks away and moves to the other side of the cabin.\n\nAs the aircraft descended, he began to recognise more of the land beneath him.

So many rifles, so many bullets that could have deterred the Japanese ended up in Chinese flesh.\n\nThe light dims.\n\nWanjialing, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing, step by step.

Politicians, workers, clerks and the minority leaders sit around round tables packed tightly in the small auditorium, barely with any space to slip through them. But none of the guests is complaining, not while their mouths are stuffed with Tibetan beef and Qinghai beer.

And as such, despite the hostility, the two families kept an unofficial peace.\n\nBut due to factors that none of them can control or expect, China has fallen and so has Ningxia. Ma Hongkui, the leader of the Ningxia branch and one of the more loyal governors, retreated with the Kuomintang forces into Qinghai. Since then, they have been crucial in deterring Japanese invasion, carefully manipulating their enemies with terrain, deception and knowledge of the land, bringing devastating losses for invaders. Despite this, Ningxia has always been the underrepresented part of the military forces, and it is more insufferable for them, knowing their rivals for decades can decide their life and death at any moment in the name of patriotism and necessary sacrifices.\n\nThis situation is now escalating the tension between the families at a rate never seen before. Qinghai and Ningxia soldiers have to be kept separated to stop them from beating each other down, and Qinghai's clerks keep ammunition from adequately supplied to Hongkui's regiments, citing 'supply shortage' issues when Chiang's own troops are armed to the teeth.

Shaoqi called me the day he visited him, Shen Zhiyue's eyes are fixed on him - the Juntong knows every single woman he sleeps with. And Hongkui's also being watched. Dunjing is coming back to his father's fold, or the other way around. And they say the sons of Hognbin are also involved to some extent... They are no doubt planning something treacherous!'\n\nThe office's door burst open and a guard rushes in, gesturing with his right hand and a few pieces of paper in the other. Gao swiftly places the telephone firmly against his palm and looks up, not before pushing his glasses. Impatience is written all over his face, Raised are his eyebrows and his eyes cold. 'The President requests your presence over at the Palace. He's been looking through reports of Qinghai agriculture back and forth... amongst other things. Perhaps he is supportive of further...' 'The petite-bourgeoisie erect yet again! How can anyone firmly communist believe in the fantasy that some feudal warlord would actually follow socialist economic policies? It is only a show for appeasement.'\n\nGao's rant quickly dies down into thoughts. Though not highly educated, he too is aware of his potential betrayal of the revolution by allying himself with the capitalistic party that is the Kuomintang. The Bolsheviks were wise to seize power from the capitalistic rightists, he thought, and Gao couldn't help but draw a parallel between Lenin and him. Would it be truly needed, even if the revolutionary nature of their party lingers in some?\n\n'Comrade Chairman...'"
 tmm.maclique.52.d:0 "Thirty-four years have passed, and for the first time, Ma Jiyuan finds the lunar new year celebration free of worries and festive. Not that this relaxation comes from the lessened workload of late, and now more than ever the Extraordinary President faces more challenges. The war economy and land reforms implemented a few years ago paid off, seeing the rebirth of a modernised albeit small economy. Yet whether the disunited government can seize such opportunities remain a headache for him, resorting to staying in his presidential office with enamel mugs of tea as his only companion for hours a day. The politicians of old are master manipulators, yet when it comes to action shortsighted are these men claiming to represent China. Is this flaw inherent to China or whatever evil in the course of history led to such a sorry state? Ma Jiyuan ponders.\n\nThe problems in Tibet troubles Ma furthermore, a man already treading himself and his policies carefully so as not to arouse opposition. Though not agitated to the point of rebellion, Tibetans led by local lamas often amass an alarming number of petitions against local government, a dangerous precedent to the discontent that the Chinese Nationalist Party knows but too well. Land reform isn't going well either, and the newcoming administration now faces the exact resistance they had back in '62 and '63. Landlords refuse to give in, and the petty kingdoms are only kept subordinate with bribes that cannot continue indefinitely. \n\nThough many roadblocks are ahead, in his ill-furnitured office Ma still holds the coming year with high regard and hope. Though the Mengzang Commission is nowhere close to thawing the intense conflicts, it is nonetheless a victory for him personally, as it drifts from Chiang's grip to his. He would gladly spend the entire day filling paperwork, as long as they are his to decide and his words still hold authority. Ridding Liu and dealing another blow to Chiang the Younger, the President trusts him and his allies shall come to dominate the Republic of China, and guide her to her ancient glory."
 tmm.maclique.53.d:0 "The ear-deafening noises of fireworks and the smell of mass-manufactured sulfur fill the streets of Golmud and Xining. People energetically greet each other, and all the memories of hardship fade only further with liquor and food. Shops open till midnight, and vendors on their wooded carts fill the streets, with crafts of gunpowder filled to the brim.\n\nIt's Golmud in the mode of the lunar new year celebration. Even in exile, the citizens refuse to let go of their millennia-old tradition. The few electrified signs on the main street are blurred by a mix of snow and grey dust raised by the gunpowder and passing trucks, and from a distance, the easterners tranced, as if the War never happened, and that they are still lingering on the roads of the Settlement.\n\nThe joyful laughs and festive mood of the town pacify not the mind of Chiang, cursing under his breath and barely able to sleep. Never harboured any love for the desolate Gobi, Chiang hardly had the mood to celebrate. The blasting noises of fireworks and sparks hitting the concrete ground only bring him foul memories.\n\nThe bombardment shook the lands of Shu harder than any earthquake or flood in history. Their bombs undid the city faster and more devastating than any elements of this world. And perished alongside the city were her people. Driven to madness and throwing themselves into the Yangtze amidst a sea of fire and gas, only to be boiled alive in the steaming river heated by an untold amount of explosives. Even beneath the sandstone hills of the city, Chiang was almost driven to insanity by the sheer scream of the land and the people. Years have passed then. Long had he parted with his father, so long as to without the few photos he and his mother still cherishes, Chiang would have not recognised the Generalissimo of the Republic.\n\nThe white noise becomes almost intelligible. He could hear Kai-Shek angrily reprimands his every defeat since then. He tries to calm himself down from this nonsense, but the voices remain, as if Chiang Kai-Shek never truly died, merely withdrawing himself from the spotlight, watching over him behind the curtains ever since, mocking him with Chen Cheng, that old bastard Kung, and the maniacal Ma Bufang. He knocks his head against his own palm and the shaking furniture, trying to escape.\n\nChiang gave up. He sits up and observes the dragon dance illuminated with red lanterns, and the starry night of Qinghai through the misted window."
 tmm.maclique.54.d:0 "The hour grows late, and for many out there in Golmud, nothing like feasting and drinking till midnight fills their hearts, tired and battered by seemingly endless work. All traditional restaurants remain open till sunrise, and none of their tables remain idle. Though a Hui by birth, Ma Dunjing has long forsaken the taboos of his people. Even if Ma Jiyuan placed orders strictly against the consumption of alcohol, years of fighting have drawn the soul out of many soldiers, and liquor, rather than Allah is the only refuge for such caste.\n\nHe wasn't given any roles in the new military just like any other Ningxia Ma officers, and such exception wasn't made for the very son of Ma Hongkui. That bastard Ma Bufang was too much of a bloodthirsty fox himself, and... convinced the exiled central army to disarm the Ningxia troops. Though a few dozen Han soldiers were allowed to bear arms and join their eastern comrades, life has been all but quiet for the Ningxia Hui, far from the political landscape.\n\nNever particularly attached to his father, Dunjing was disappointed to find Hongkui intends to maintain the status quo and tried to put him in his place, claiming things like 'unity' and the 'greater good' that Dunjing simply couldn't care less. His rebellious nature only accelerated the expulsion of him from the household amidst a fierce argument between Dunjing and his father, an outcome only beneficial to the son. Siphoning funds and wielding his influence, Dunjing amassed a few followers, all of them disgruntled NCOs of the Ningxia Army, spending his time running brothels, highly sort-after by the soldiery now without entertainment to distract them otherwise.\n'Cheers to the modern-day Xie An of Qinghai!'. A red-faced friend sitting to his right greets him as he raises his glass dulled by time, only to find a confused Dunjing.\n'Who the hell is this Xie?'\n'A... a prime minister of whatever god-damn dynasty, all he could care for after retirement is sex! Not so different from you bastard.'\n'We...well, he deserves it...! A great general, born of noble family, too.' A Han officer adds to the drunkard. 'Far-spread are his deeds and glory. His thirst for women is only matched by the cities he took '\nFar from a history enthusiast, Dunjing laughs along with the men to keep the mood happy, but the name of Xie An was etched into his mind."
 tmm.maclique.55.d:0 "It's been a few months since the Mid-Autumn festival, yet it has never left Liu's home. As it is custom for the Chinese to give gifts to their superiors, colleagues, and families. Liu, a man once very close towards the tip of the pyramid is bound to have his share even after his supposed retirement from politics, a whole mountain of which that certainly does not give guests a good impression on the host, even for Ma Dunjing.\n\nMa turns around and before he knows it, gazes upon two cups of hot tea and the thin, lightly stained metal tray beneath. Placed next to it is one of those semi-transparent glass plates found in the East, with an assortment of mooncakes stacked on it.\n\n'Take as many as you like home, I have trouble even giving them out for free. Long since you visited my place.' said Liu, trying to distract him out partially out of embarrassment,  'Dunjing. I imagine it would be almost certain we would be having more than just tea, is it not?'\n\n'Well, there is no need to hide my intentions then. Cunning are you old men from the east.' Even so, Dunjing couldn't help but peek around before he speaks, much to Liu's annoyance.\n\n'Brother Shaoqi, I am staging an uprising around and in the Northern Barracks.'\n\n'A coup?'Even Liu was caught off guard by the simple statement, his expensive china almost slipping away from his fingers. Though Liu is no stranger to the affairs of the military, he wouldn't imagine Dunjing would be so bold as to utter it in front of him. 'A great surprise, indeed.'\n\n'We are no rabble of mindless butchers. I wouldn't have wanted it, but the situation demands it. I don't ask much of you besides having some of your Red Army support our movement. I know you despise that son of a bitch Gao. We would be glad to aid your ambitions. All we need is a justification.'\n\nMa Dunjing proceeds to push half-shocked Liu further, seeking at least some promises from the old man. Liu Shaoqi hastily made some grandiose yet meaningless statements to the latter's satisfaction, who left not soon after, claiming he is arousing more to his cause."
 tmm.maclique.56.d:0 "'You certain Mr. Jianying would bring his men to the town?'\n\nMa Dunjing grows reckless, pacing back and forth, much to the dislike of Liu Shaoqi. Though as someone almost withdrawn from political and military matters, he held little rights to rebuke Ma.\n\n'I give you my words. Pei-tsun and his followers shall be swiftly annihilated. At which point the city would have been cut off from north and south. It would be but a parade.' Uttered a somewhat distracted Liu, seemingly disconnected from reality.\n\nHe gazes upon that old Ma Hongkui, who is making himself comfortable on a rattan chair. He's been only getting more obese by the years, a wonder the furniture even holds him firm in the first place.\n\n'Mr.... Mr. Liu, ah... Shaoqi... forgive me, Comrade Shaoqi! What comes to your mind?'' Said Dunjing, his face is a mixture of grin and distrust. 'Ah, I was considering how comrade Luo would hold the police for long enough. They are all quite tough to deal with.' Liu quickly came up with things to at least distract the young ambitious man.\n\nMa Dunjing cracked a laugh, yet bound within the expression Liu senses as if Ma Dunjing is begging him for support. He thought for someone looking to coup a government, they'd have more confidence in speech. 'Ah well, resilient is your party and men. We can do it alone, but it would be bloody. Not worth the cause. We want the Republic reborn, not bloodied and battered. The... the twenty-five thousand Li March! You made it all the way through while under fire and all that... stuff. You've taken on them before, surely you could help us understand their tactics... However, it is still a surprise you would come onboard so... swiftly, with little persuasion needed.'\n\nIs he all but too disconnected from history or is he putting up an act? Liu finds himself confused. Hongkui was likely among the very leaders who wiped out Zhang's ill-fated expedition to the northwest.  Though nowhere near a friend of that party-breaking traitor, great remorse he had for the thousands that never returned.\n\n'It's all for the best interests of China, Long have I thought about this ordeal, but I made my decision.' said Liu, 'And Chairman Mao told us,"
 tmm.maclique.57.d:0 "'Mr. Gao and Mr. Chiang, your presence is much respected. Please, make yourselves at home.' Ma Jiyuan gestures. Neither very enthusiastic nor appalled, the President is increasingly reserving his emotions and opinions from outsiders.\n\n'What courtesy! Inviting us over for a feast? I didn't expect it, but a welcoming one nonetheless.' Gao sniffs. The chairman appears much more light-hearted, and so is Chiang accompanying him. 'I say President Ma worries too much! If we truly want something special out of it, I hired a few cooks from the easterners. Authentic Chungking chefs. Most wonderful for these occasions.' \n\nJust as sudden as he invited the most powerful leaders of Qinghai to his home, Ma's expression changed in merely a blink. Perhaps out of his well-received goodwill, or putting on his cloak as a proper Chinese politician. 'I would not have thought such! It's all but well-deserved gratitude from us. I've seen some of those from the east have little love for our lands. If only they'd had true Northwestern cuisine. Come on, linger outside no further, come on in.' \n\nThe typical Chinese 'dinner-negotiation' went on fairly well, aided by the three in mutual understanding to keep politics out of their conversation. Despite this, exhausting every other topic only brings close the inevitable. Ma Jiyuan is well aware of Gao's disapproval of Chiang in many policies and vice versa. In the public, this crack in unity was for the most part hidden behind their smiling faces and rousing gestures. \n\n'Jianfeng, what of the Legislative Yuan? I imagine extensive work is claiming more and more of your time.' 'Not that it would overwhelm me, though I cannot say it does not bother me either, President,' Ching-kuo replies, seemingly without much care, masked behind steam. 'Oh well, I suppose some delegation would be most helpful. I've been thinking about assigning Gao as the vice-chairman of the Yuan to assist your effort. What say you?' Ma Jiyuan asks in an almost jokingly tone. \n\nGao Gang cracks smile too in accordance with traditional customs, yet his eyes are fixed on Chiang the Younger. Chiang looks up from his bowl, glancing upon the equally misted two. For a few seconds, he felt as if his heart skipped a few beats, and his mind strayed. 'Not bad proposition. However, I don't think this appointment would be... constitutional, Mr. President. I would help you out as much as I can, but there are... some outside my reach, if you know what I mean.' Chiang rises as he pours tea from an aged enamel bottle for Ma. \n\nFeeling awkward, Ma too raises his cup, gesturing towards Chiang before emptying his drink. 'So what says you, Ruiqin? Are the lamb shutting you up?' \n\n'I'm... no secretary...' the usual gong-like voice of the northwestern man is barely recognisable, with a mouthful of meat and alcohol, 'I would be most unsuitable for the task, President! If you insist on... getting someone to do it, get Shaoqi."
 tmm.maclique.58.d:0 "Though hailing from Hezhou, Lu Zhongliang's has always fought for the Ningxia and by extension Chinese cause. A regiment alienated by the very government it swore to protect, but at the very least he was a proper captain, with thousands alleging to him.\n\nThe Battle of Lhasa was rough. Altitude sickness made many casualties, and the terrain around the town did not help. He remembers the fierce street skirmishes and the Potala Palace, filled to the brim with hostile Tibetans and archaic artillery. Though outdated, Lu quickly learned when struck by them, the swift and brutal death they deliver differs little from those of the Japanese.\n\nWhile the border troops of petty Tusis and kingdoms offered little resistance, the British-equipped and trained forces directly commanded by the Kashag dealt severe casualties to his regiment, appointed to act as the Chinese vanguard entering the city. Many have fallen.\n\nThe combat ineffective regiment of Lu, having lost a third of its personnel was quickly caught victim of Qinghai's opportunism, swiftly scrapped the unit from its ranks. Ma Jiyuan's personal appointment of him to Golmud garrison did little to ease his mind. The banner of the regiment, preserved and hanged high in his home, occasionally dancing with cold morning currents through the windows, drags his mind back to that cursed battle.\n\nBesides raging alcoholism, the only thing Lu could do is wargaming. Two such tables, one outlining the city of Golmud and that of Lhasa. Though still bitter over the loss of his unit, for the most part, Lu chose to work with Qinghai Mas so that no Chinese blood would be further spilled. Enemies he can outsmart and warfare he can master, yet these serve but as distractions till his eventual retirement.\n\nAfter a day's worth of strategic planning at the garrison headquarters in the north, he dashed straight for the sand tables. The pieces are neatly set aside on a small bench, to Lu's great frustration as he placed them down the night before for a simulated siege of Golmud. And yet there was something else.\n\nA single piece of old, crispy newspaper, with words written on it."
 tmm.maclique.59.d:0 "Gradually the final dust settles. The fervor of celebration gradually ceases and life returns to normal. For the ladies of the Republic, however, there is yet one more those feathering they must participate. The annual meeting of the National Women's League takes place not soon after, attended by many prominent families. Though the founder Soong Mei-ling remain abroad, The locals have taken it upon themselves to organise the women of Qinghai.\n\nKnown in Qinghai as the Matriarchs' Circle for the lack of young faces, the organisers tried to get students and daughters of political leaders onboard. Chiang himself was absent, and Gao Gang only briefly addressed the league along with his girl before quickly withdrawing themselves from the scene, seemingly out of his dislike of the Kuomintang.\n\nLiu Aiqin found it less surprising and silently waited. As the leaders begin their lengthy speech praising and awarding 'patriotic women' near the end, she retreats behind and slipped through the crowds to an inconspicuous room not too far from the main gate of the auditorium. Chiang Hsiao-chang has been expecting her for a while there.\n\n'All the stuff's on the table. Spread them out, lest it is too suspicious.'\n\n'I assume these are all letters and ...' Liu flickers through the small packages hastily put together. 'Yes, yes, among other things. Spend no time reading them now, though. I told them to have my mother on the stage to delay it for a bit, but it can end at any time.'\n\n'Right... Right. Please pass on my father and my own thanks. We appreciate your efforts greatly.' \n\n'So shall it be. Same to Mr. Shaoqi. We weren't able to extract anything from your party. Gao is tightening it up, be careful.'\n\n'I've got it all packed up, you reckon anything gives me away.?' Hsiao-chang observed closely, carefully examining a military trenchcoat donning Liu. 'Well, as far as I am aware you should appear... fine...Though there is one more thing.'\n\n'What is it?' Though older, Liu is nowhere near as secure as Hsiao-chang is, and her eyes are now emanating growing anxiety.\n\n'I don't know if you have a use for it, but I've got this lipstick I don't really like. American stuff...never used! You want it?'"
 tmm.maclique.60.d:0 "Smoke rises from the city, all while the riders of Ma Dunxing make haste to the estates of Ma Jiyuan east to the city, raising wings of dust and dirt as they ride against the rising sun. \n\nDunxing has no love of the adventure, however. The very thought of finding vassalage under Hongkui their long rival disgusts him deeply, and yet weak is their power, whichever wanes since the death of Ma Hongbin, his old man, giving him and his family to seek refuge under that fat scum of a warlord, using them ever for jobs Dunxing harboured much dissent and sometimes hatred. One such thing is demanding a thorough investigation of Ma Jiyuan's properties for alleged storage of liquor. He is certain that should he not move quickly, the column of Ningxia would most likely be noticed by Qinghai forces and rounded up to whatever end, a fate Dunxing much desired to avoid.\n\nThe mansions of Ma Jiyuan stand out from any Dunxing'd seen, not that there's much nearby to see. Its arches exotic and its windows well kept. Double layered, too. American stuff for a Hui President, Dunxing couldn't help but gaze upon it.\n\nOut from concrete guardhouses sprang the guards of Ma Jiyuan. Their helmets reflect sunlight perfectly, contrasting it with the dusted sandbags and fences surrounding the premise.\n\n'What the hell do you think you will be doing here, General Dunxing? The House of the President is not a place where you and your armed men can choose to appear uninvited!' As a dismounted Dunxing was about to open his mouth and negotiate, the guards seemed to entertain not such an idea. Besides, even from metres away he could already sense the arrogance of those privileged enough so as to have no need to worry for their livelihood.\n\nThe young general approaches the leader of the group with great speed, and within a few seconds, he finds himself grabbing the guard by his collars.\n\n'You have no power over us! We are here... in the name of our Rabb! Keep you and your men out, and no harm will come to you.'\n\nImmediately sirens scream, and more of them come out, each of them holding firmly a M14 rifle against Dunxing and his more numerous men, who too raises their weapon in a standoff.\n\n'Let us through!"
 tmm.maclique.61.d:0 "'This bitch is mine, find your own!' With a woman tightly bound to him by his left arm, Ma Chongde angrily dismisses Ma Dunjing with his right in an intense scene. A longtime rival to the cousin of Ma Jiyuan, Dunjing has been restraint for most of the time to keep his profile low. However, the influx of liquor and the shear stress of his scheme finally overcomes his senses, as he pulls out his C96 and shot. Silent was the cartridge hitting the ground, the same cannot be said for Chongde, shot right in the chest.\n\nThe woman flees in horror, as Chongde continues his tirade of provocation. 'How...dare you son of a bitch to shoot back! Even if I die, you shall not escape from the President... Jiyuan will have you...'\n\nBefore he could spit out more threats, another round of 7.63mm Mauser to the head quickly brought it to an end. A mire of blood, plasma stained Chongde's uniform and the remaining half of his skull in a disgusting pattern of amber and red, much to the distress of even Dunjing's fellow men, all while the half-drunken son of Hongkui shout words even himself finds too much later on.\n\n'My General, I understand... uh, your emotions, but most of the city would have heard it. Should we do the deed?' An aide suggests, trying to steer his eyes away from the scene and onto the streets of Golmud outside, a flood of electronic light and shouts taking over Golmud. \n\n'Uh... aye, you're right... Signal the men and General Lu, we can wait no longer.' answers Dunjing, withdrawing himself from the murder back to reality. 'Tell them to make ready for rapid movement, this is no defendable position. Inform me of Dunxing's' progress if any signal is given.'\n\nOutside city proper, Lu Zhongliang carefully observes Yanchunguan burst into flames, much to his disbelief. 'Sir! You need to read th...' an officer quickly rushes to his side, on top of one of the watchtowers.\n\n'There is no need! What the fuck is this young rascal thinking? Unbelievable... Put it away, inform them... Everyone! Arm themselves and get moving to the town! The Uprising can delay no longer!'"
 tmm.maclique.62.d:0 "To think Ma Jiyuan, such a well-known figure would be trapped by a petty Ningxia officer is thought truly alienating, and yet here Dunxing is, with the President within his grasp. Though his adversaries are far better equipped, they are well aware they themselves would be mowed down. He releases the guard, knowing it would have changed little, the latter went flying till he is well behind his comrade. He turns and stares at him angrily, yet did not raise his weapon.\n\nHeavy is the smoke rising from the city, and loud are the gunshots. He is the final piece of the puzzle. Ningxia Ma troops and General Lu are on the move, and yet he has little confidence. If one will betray his thought-out plan over a whore, Dunxing couldn't help but reconsider his allegiance. Those dumb bastards will likely ruin things, and if the entire coup goes down because of that stupid kid, he will certainly pay dearly. A price he cannot afford, for Dunxing is the only other son of Ma Hongbin, a legacy he simply cannot risk tarnishing with treachery. The weird look Liu Shaoqi gave before they moved out only raises more doubt in his mind. Maybe yet it would not be to late to turn around.\n\nAll of sudden, he senses movement from within the estate. Something disorganised and distressful. He hears the crying screams of Ma Jiyuan's wife, and out marches the Extraordinary President of the Republic of China.\n\n'Lower your weapons! Let no more bloodshed come between those with common goals.' Ma Jiyuan speaks in a tired tone. 'I recognise even if mine soldiers are to resist they would not stand a chance. I know you and your masters' purpose. I will go with you... on the condition that no harm comes to my family or these faithful men.'\n\nMa Dunxing quiets down, and long was the silence between the two sons of the greater Ma Family before the former breaks the ice.\n\n'We would have a surrender ceremony here but you shall not be the one on your knees, Mr. President.' The young general pulls out his Luger and places it firmly in Ma Jiyuan's hand, clearly feeling the sweat.\n\n'You will make haste to the Southern Barracks. I hope the hour is not too late.'"

The General Secretary did not consider Dunxing's last minute betrayal a possibility, and yet here he is.\n\nGao outs up a defeated look, greeting the two rides on foot.\n\n'President Ma, you are in terrible shape. I do hope no harm has come to you.' Gao sniffs, 'An open rebellion? I would have not imagined it in my wildest dreams, and yet here we are. And that Liu Shaoqi would align with the traitors is even more surprising. If we defeat them and have that bastard Liu caught alive, he would have preferred a shot to his head.'\n\nGao paces around in great frustration, and suddenly comes to a stop, almost as if he is mourning. 'I appreciate your recognition of the legitimacy of the government, yet you still swore allegiance elsewhere. I hope you do understand what we must do.' The General Secretary makes a gesture to communist soldiers, who surround Ma Dunxing's horse. Before they'd pull him down from it, Dunxing voluntarily surrendered himself, and swiftly escorted away. Gao appears to murmur something, but President Ma couldn't quite catch what he's saying amidst the noises.\n\n'Don't worry. We Communists yet hold truth in words, no harm would come to him. Still I find great interest in such a man. Surely he has informed you of something.'\n\n'Well, I barely had the time to even discuss anything. We weren't on a road trip, General Secretary.' The President seems to be both confused and rather awkward, continuing on to explain he wouldn't press Dunxing further lest he flip again, all while Gao fixes his eyes on those of Ma. 'A shame. Though if he knows anything, he would surrender them out sooner or later. It matters not. Guards, take care of Mr. President... and before everything, get him changed. One wouldn't be leading our Republic in dusted military jackets.'\n\nGao excuses himself for Chiang, who has been hiding himself in one of the officer quarters from Ma Jiyuan. 'Who could have thought blood of stubbornness run in the veins of the sons of Ma Hongbin?' Chiang smiled, shaking his hands firmly with Gao Gang.\n\n'Though these are of little significance. Ma Jiyuan, Dunxing, Dunjing and whatever warlords and leaders.'\n\nChiang nods.\n\n'Duan Qirui cared not for the opinions of Zhang Xun and Emperor Puyi.'"

Recognising hatred now rules the streets and alleys of Golmud, those with the means are quickly forming large groups of humans and animals outside the town, before the madness catches them too.\n\nThough General Ma Dunjing allowed the refugee to pass unopposed, it is still a mess beyond his imagination. A sea of wooden carts and cries of the children are the only living noise coming out of the silent columns.\n\n'Quick! There are a few ox carts whose owner still possesses mercy. Tell your old man and get them out of this place!' A nervous middle-aged man finds a single child still playing with wooden sticks and sand in front of the Chengnan apartments. He also notices there are way more than what a single kid needs.\n\n'My father said we aren't going anywhere. We'd be staying and this is the last few hours I'm even allowed outside, so I'm here.' said the youngling.\n\n'Is your father mad? Can't he see the coming storm?

This is no simple riot, they will come with grenades, horses, and mortars! Change your mind and flee at once!' said the concerned man.\n\n'Flee? We have nowhere to! Thirty years since I have departed my dear homeland. Twenty since we left Xi'an and fifteen winters ago we fled Chongqing!

His aging father signed him into the KLA the next day he turned sixteen, saying he would be the generation marching on Hanseong if he truly strives for his people. However, the sheer disappointment of Jong-Woo following his enlistment couldn't be more understated. \n\nFor the Korean Liberation Army, Japan is not their greatest enemy, but the ruthless march of time. Courage and experience are the only two things barely holding them combat effective, and as such, the Chinese have assigned them to police Golmud and patrol around it so as to save manpower for the Front. Two years have passed since then, and Kim barely even used the issued Luger. If he and other young initiates didn't secretly join a column of Communist soldiers for Qaidam last month, they would stay idle till the end of time, a fate he is accustomed to but not comfortable with. Just as Golmud never rains, Kim considers his life predictable, something he would have avoided at all costs in an alternative world where Korea never died.\n\nThough change is coming and he can feel it. Communist and Nationalist soldiers are becoming more of a common sight, and rarer still tanks and armoured cars of the NRA were spotted the day before reaching for the south. Though he couldn't care less what the Chinese are up to, President Ji and General Lee told them to make ready and live ammunition was issued to all Korean exiles.\n\n'Dae-Woo! Come here, we have a few crates of grenades. Help this old man move it to the walls.' A veteran's call pulled Jim's mind back to reality. As he stands up and clear the dust off his pants, a thunderous noise took the young soldier by surprise. \n\nHe looks back to the old warrior, only to find him suddenly pushing the supplies away from the courtyard with all of his might and moving away from where he is, 'Get out of there, it's a mortar ro..' \n\nBefore Kim could comprehend it, an explosion sent him flying into the Siheyuan. Concrete fragments and dust covers all over him, though luckily non of the shrapnel did.\n\nAnother dread noise.

He looks worried, covered in deep thoughts. He'd uncover the cloth and see the grain and salted meat he'd brought with the family all the way from Altai from time to time, mumbling something incomprehensible, as if making a momentous decision. 'You know I am no children, right? If we are running short on something, tell me. We will figure out a way. Our greater family have been generous and they would surely lend us something.' The wife is growing anxious, yet her speech remains soft.\n\n'Mayla, get me a bag.' said Bay.\n\n'What? Bay...But you can't be thinking about the food!' Mayla springs up angrily towards her husband, until all the wrinkles are clearly distinguishable, deepened by Bay's worrying look. 'I know what you intend to do. Look at us, Bay! We are the opposite of what your name suggests. We...Ugh, we need them for the time being. Your pity! It reigns even above livelihood, a noble trait I respect, but not in this hour.'\n\n'Well, but you said we could arrange some from our relatives. But look at them! Animals we can hunt and cattles we can milk, but what the Han could do? Nothing! It could mean a big difference!' said Bay, while putting his hand on Mayla's shoulders. 'We feed them for the sake of Allah, seeking neither rewards nor thanks. After all, did not our LORD pronounce these words?'\n\nMayla shook off Bay's tough palms, and stood aside, as she watches Bay depart with a sack of food towards the city of Golmud, smoke columns rising as if trees of intoxicating gas rising above concrete bushes.\n\nA group of children and women, lost from the main column due to shellings are hiding in half-collapsed houses. A simple campfire emits warmth, but there is no life, for even the very young now grasp the concept of death, ever creeping towards them. And yet there was a string of heavy knocks on the door.\n\n'Ai..am de Kazakhs you... you arr saved. We knaows de hour of repaimend hath come. Eat well.

Even for Qinghai, one of the least modernised and poorest provinces of China, a seemingly inexhaustible army of horses, mules reinforced with a dozen yaks was a scene even some locals have yet to bear witness to. Most of them are civilian supply convoys bringing in food and goods from Xining and the countryside into the city, and its people out from the brewing storm.\n\nLin stands by his aging mount upon a dwarf hill of scorched sand, overlooking the convoy of animals and humans slowly moving in and out, each for their own reasons. He's been lucky enough insofar. For those fleeing without the intention of returning any time soon, the rebels, though officially not supposed to deny their departure, would stop travelers and demand they pay a relatively insignificant sum of money for using roads. It is only till one turns around and sees yet another roadblock does one realise he would be not stepping outside the city till one empty their purses. Lin knows not where or when did men of Ningxia learn of the accursed tricks of money-hoarding warlords of Sichuan, but he cares not now. \n\nHe feels bad for those yet to discover the true nature of all this. Especially that slightly alcoholic girl he usually sits with. He tries to convince himself he wouldn't have been able to bring another one out even if he tried, but the thought still haunts him. It wasn't till a waving figure in the distance that broke his thought process. A woman, it seems. If it wasn't for the woman's silhouette against the sun strongly resembled his mother, Lin might just keep idling for longer.\n\n'Hey, you! Young man! Are, are you a student by any chance?' Seemingly exhausting all of her might, the aged woman loudly shouts. Though Lin never particularly liked talking to others, that elder is all too close for him to ignore.\n\n'Yes, yes old lady. I am. I assume you are seeking the educated for...?' said Lin.\n\n'Yes, your kind! Lucky enough to know writing and reading. Forgive me, for I am too old and unenlightened for literary things. But I have an urgent need for bright minds like you, young one.' The old woman is not known for philosophies, but certainly her haste.\n\n'I have a son... wouldn't be much older than you. He's in Xining, far off from these places. I don't know if I can reach there alive, but I do need my words to reach him before I do either way. Could you spare a paper and pen for this old woman?'"

The elderly man seems to have little shock, less than what the Ningxia soldiers expected. Politics have nothing to do with him now, and Xueliang expected any hostile actions by the rebel regime towards him.\n\nHe's been in Golmud almost two weeks longer than he anticipated. Though kept away from hunger, long has he felt great sorrow for the nation and stress for his own life. So much for the master of the Northeast, thought Xueliang. He who saved the United Front in Xi'an shall now taste the bitterness of it.\n\nLong had he desired to leave this place, but for the most part, his pleads were mostly ignored, no longer. Two or three squads of riflemen are now at his gate. Many northeastern men, who have followed him since the tragic fall of their homeland came out. Seeing the tension, the old soldiers thought men of Ningxia are here to claim their leader's head, and struggled greatly with the rebels. Many were injured on both sides, more detained.\n\nIt wasn't until a leader of the Ningxia army dispersed his fighters did they come to an understanding with the northeasterners. They are here to take him away. Back to Xining. Zhang Xueliang felt great relief, as the Ningxia officer led him to the streets outside. It was then that he realised there are too few trucks awaiting the first exiles of all Chinese.\n\nThe officer told the Young Marshal they went to great length to prepare transportation only because of his status. And none more can be secured. He boards it and found a great number of Northeasterners have surrounded them, their eyes emanating confusion and worries.\n\n'...They have followed me ever since 1931, captain. I think you too understand the bonds of families and people. Let me at least address them.' said a defeated Xueliang.\n\n'Do it at once.' said the officer.\n\nIn his characteristic northeastern accent, the Young Marshal makes perhaps the one last speech to his people."
 tmm.maclique.74.d:0 "It was a fierce battle with Ningxia infiltrators, but the preparations of Zhao Ziyang paid off. As he orders all militia to simultaneously deliver a barrage of a few dozen grenades towards enemy positions, they cowardly broke. Those who tried to flee were mowed down mercilessly by old Czech machineguns, and those who did not scream in utter horror as the rebels burst into a firework of flesh and black powder. It didn't take long for the show of strength to convince the survivors to surrender, their hands in the air and their battered flag low.\n\nThough sandbags and trenches are dug in zig-zag lines, it didn't help when facing the so-called 'Black Hearted' homemade grenades. Packed with sheer cruelty, these improvised explosives are filled with steel pins and plentiful metal and glass pieces. Most victims are still on their backs in agonising pain when the militia carried them away.\n\n'Comrade Zhao, these are the bastards who attacked our men, I say we..' Zhao's aide quickly rushes to the leader, his right hand holding his cloth cap while he runs across, seeing he was amongst the first to accept the surrender.\n\n'Well, then I assume the murderer of Comrade Hu will be somewhere here either dead or alive, do you think not?' Zhao spoke, without looking back, as his eyes are fixed on the enemy platoon commander.\n\n'Oh well, From the reports I think it is this man, but let us not jump towar...'\n\nZhao unholsters his Luger. A thunderous noise sent the aide stepping back in horror, seeing his enemy falling onto the ground, his body twisting and his blood and plasma liberally flowing out from his blasted skull.\n\n'Comrade Zhao, this is rather unnecessary, by the order of the Party we must send them to be court-martialed!' the young soldier looks deeply shocked. 'And last time I looked, Comrade Tang, is that I have supreme authority over the company on the matters of war. Traitors deserve no trial.'\n\n'But... we have cameramen here!' Tang points towards the broken shops on the side of the street. A single black eye mounted on tripods seems to have seen all. Angered, Zhao pushes his glasses before marching towards it. He would have well seized it if it wasn't for the owner of the camera to reveal himself at the last moment."

My parents died in Chongqing and you want to incur more deaths? I will make sure your fucking pointless life is forfeited first!'\n\nHis raging attack was only stopped by other soldiers who came in defense of the squad leader, a middle-aged man, with prominent scars on his right cheek. He stood there and moved not, nor did he speak anything towards the enraged youth. Before the scene escalates further, screams from the ruins rushed rationality back to both parties as they raise their arms and investigate.\n\nIt was a soldier, seemingly have fallen, yet there is no wound. The commander moves forward and examines, only to find more shocking troopers. Their faces were distressed and their arms weak and shaking. Limbs of varying sizes could be seen everywhere, ranging from those in league with regular Dadaos to those...\n\nSomeone vomited, and others were silent. The squadron leader tried to say something to calm the people down, but a bullet in his right arm brought him down.\n\n'The son of bitches have come, don't waste your ammunition!' yelled the commander, who violently shook off the hands of those trying to aid him, as he raises above ruins with his pistol. A string of loud noises and crystal clear sounds of bullet casings hitting the ground, as an enemy falls to the ground like a sock puppet. A small but intense exchange of fire ensued, and yet the enemy seems to have not been enthusiastic about the engagement and fled soon.\n\nThe young soldier trying to beat his commander up was injured, but luckily it was a parabellum that barely scratched his skin. Rushed into temporary hospitals with others, he was quickly patched and set aside, while he sits on a stool waiting for orders. Though there are no fightings around him, the carnage is the sole word he can use to describe it. Too few doctors and too many wounded. A soldier has his entire arm amputated, and all the medics could do is to bandage the wound, all while the amputee screams in utmost agony without any painkiller to give to him, in an amateur chorus of misery, and blood."

Her mind prays to the Most Beneficient, her body hastens with her shovel and hands.\n\nShe and others pushes a huge concrete slab onto placed metallic rods, revealing a string of cries from a minor, and the face of a horrified boy screaming words she can't understand. Tongues of the East. Gulyuz tries to comfort him, but a sudden slap on her shoulder almost drew her soul away, as she suddenly turns around, only to see a military officer, equally surprised.\n\n'Ms. Gulyuz, the lines won't hold, we cannot risk any harm to you ladies. Make haste towards the South at once!' yelled the officer, as the chorus of grenades and bullets start to overwhelm her and the man.\n\n'But...' uttered Gulyuz. Before she could finish, the man grabbed her arms and helped her stood up. The officer did not speak, yet his eyes have already conveyed all that he would. He throws her into soldiers, as they hurry the Kazakh women onto a schoolbus hastedly painted white. The frontline departs her, as does the cacophony of this world. Even through the metal plating of the vehicles, Gulyuz feels as if she could hear the voice of the boy fainting, slowly drowning beneath the sea of torment. She tries to comfort herself over the thought, but it has come to no use. Others are equally silent, some covering their face in hands drenched with blood and dust. Even those who have answered the call of the misfortunate have their head lowered. Their hijab hide their eyes from sight, but not their trembling lips."

They took the City Halls and are advancing towards the eastern portions of the city. They are now essentially bordering us around the Jinfeng road, between the areas leading out of the city towards the east and the post office. In the west, they have made gains towards the Presidential Palace, the Kuomintang headquarters, and the southwestern suburbs including the Korean enclave.'.

A flank upon their forces shall swiftly end this.' Ma Dunjing dismisses Lu, even as they failed to defeat Kuomintang forces initially, and was unable to decisively end it all.\n\nAn aide rushes to Lu and whispers something to him.. 'General... General Ma, we have a most extraneous circumstance brewing indeed. Ma Dunxing won't be coming. Our scouts broke through and had made confirmation that Dunxing has surrendered himself to Ma Jiyuan. They would be with the United Front, scathless.'  Even clearly lit by kerosene lamps, his face appears rather pale. 'The flanking maneuvres won't be taking place. In fact, it would be lucky if we ourselves aren't outflanked.'\n\nBefore he could appropriately finish his statement, a clear snapping sound interrupted the meeting. A pencil, severed in two halves on the sand table, rendered the murmuring staff silent.\n\nMa Dunjing stayed silent for quite a while before he finally spoke.\n\n'These are all giving them too much time. We must make a dash towards the heart and surgically and precisely rid of it. General Lu, I would like you to summon... a platoon or so. Not too many, a large force would only disturb too many sentries. Equip them appropriately, tell them they must seize the big military depot and set it ablaze at once.'\n\n'But, but it would be unwise! The road is open and straight. Ideal kill boxes of machine gun and cannons.' Objected Lu. 'They are probably expecting it. At least if I was to mount defense, I would certainly get a few maps and start placing guards'"

Their steps heavy and their breaths loud. It wasn't until the entire platoon entered an enclosure within urban areas till He and his communist guerillas revealed themselves.\n\n'Where did you come from, traitors? We have you all surrounded!' He shouts, as flashlights shower upon the Ningxia detachment. Blinded by the flooding light, they couldn't even recognise where the Communists came from till they realise every single balcony surrounding them was well manned, in their iconic Russian ushankas, with their oiled machine guns pointing down.'Don't! Don't shoot! We mean you no harm, brothers! We are here to surrender... We want to be...uh, comrades! Comrades with all of you.' As if they have anticipated or even drilled for this event, the Ningxia soldiers all spontaneously dropped their weapons, their hands raised.\n\n'Don't you try fraternising with us, men of Ningxia! One of you move and it will be game over.' One of the militia yelled.\n\n'Fine! We'll comply. We never wanted this war, don't take us for stupid sons of Ma Hongkui! We hated harming our people and serving under that oppressive idiot. We heard you would accept us, so we came under the pretext of raiding.' said the leading man, in a heavy Gansu accent.\n\n'General Secretary Gao did say something about it, huh. Political commissars were trying to do the exact thing, uniting with reactionaries like you.' He said while making gestures for holstering their weapons. 'If you truly mean it, one day you may call me a comrade.'\n\n'...Um, comrades, I would like you all to do something for us.' The Gansu man said, seemingly have just recovered if from his memory. 'Would you be fine... if you can shoot into the air, make a show so they believe we are dead.'\n\nHe pondered a while before agreeing to the request. He then ordered several Thompsons to empty their magazines, all while the men of Ningxia screamed as hard as they can."

But it is what the situation demands.\n\nLin quietly pushes through one of the wooden doors seemingly beyond repair. The creaking noise almost sent him flying the scene. Today though, no one was patrolling around.\n\nWhat was concealed behind that meager barrier lays an entirely different world. Though it cannot be described as festive, there are enough men, words, and light for the secret gathering place to be called living, at the very least. A few dozen are already here, and cheap poplar tables set up along the way in present to Lin a variety of goods. While some are barely visible with the aid of kerosene, some small packages made of oily, brown paper, presumably containing foodstuff, are made more prevalent with bulbs emanating a weary orange light. \n\nThe intense fighting is consuming both sides hundreds or even thousands of rounds on a daily basis. With supplies in acute shortage, banknotes are no longer accepted by vendors, seeing they have fallen beyond any value within the city of Golmud. Bullet casings, however, yet maintain worth, for both sides desire to recycle these tiny metal bits for another round of slaughter. Some have been killed gathering them, but they are still in high demand to the point both armies chose to ignore such illegal activities, as long as they are getting their share out of it.\n\nLin though finds the idea too unsettling. The Chinese aren't usually devout followers of any given religion, but he couldn't help but think about the origins of these blood-stained currencies. Would the ghosts of those killed by it watch over him in animosity? Perhaps right now as he thinks of it? Surely they understand the reality and know he wished not for the death of them in the first place? \n\nLin tries to focus on what is instead of what was. He's got a whole family to feed, and he already skipped dinner twice, and ghastly thoughts aren't getting him anywhere."

They are keeping everyone's activity minimal, apparently to save energy. I don't study biology and wouldn't know if it truly works like that, but I probably have to take that in for now.\n\nMost have fled, and now... well, not all. Shouldn't have indulged myself with that much alcohol. There's an exchange of fire around every corner. I tried to peak outside, and all I could see are bodies. Passerbys and men-at-arms. A few stray artillery shells almost took out one of the lecturers. Even under the cover of darkness, students can't make it back without getting caught by patrols. The lucky ones pay it off with bribes.\n\nThough I'm not alone. I guess everyone decided to throw a party on the night of the coup. For some reason, they are yet to occupy most of the lecture halls and dormitories towards the northeastern side, so here I am in one piece. Though it isn't good either. Water and food supplies are cut off, and we have to rely on some unconventional sources. They are trying to dig a well in one of the gardens, but I doubt they are going to strike water anytime soon.\n\nIt's a hell of a mess even within the confines of the buildings. I don't even want to describe the things people will do for water and a sack of rice. At least we are holding out, but it's unsustainable. The government forces are yet to clear out the rebels, and soon I probably have to witness some entirely otherworldy stuff unfold. I'll try to be mild with language, in case someone else finds out about it.\n\nIt's getting dark and by orders of the student union we have to go completely dark. Long shadows of metal frames supporting glass panels are drifting on the page as I am writing. Brightly orange rays of light, tinted grey with the amount of dust accumulated on the outside.

He'd expected it in the slums behind the fancy facades covering the shame of the town away from most people, but the scale of which is truly beyond his wildest imaginations. \n\nOriginally hastily built as camps of workers constructing the city, these structures left by the first generation colonists never truly disappeared. Even when some are replaced by more modernised prefab apartments, it is still an utterly confusing maze. Yang himself hails from one such complex, but the short distance of a few hundred metres is enough to alternate the surroundings in its entirety. Its unending corridors are almost enchanted, emitting an aura of esoteric mystery when abandoned. So much does the emptiness and the inorganic occupy his mind, that the living slips off his guard. Fortunately, neither did his opponent.\n\nThe two stared at each other in utmost silence for almost a minute. It took him a few seconds more to recognise the stranger. White cloth over his forehead, not of a slim build but not too excessively bulky. His face broad and his poorly trimmed hair short. He wears a light blue uniform that has almost completely bleached, presumably washed too many times. \n\nAnd he is among the ranks of the Ningxia army.\n\nThe Hui man didn't raise his weapon if his improvised grenade armed on a crossbow could be even called as one. Yang's fingers however lay firmly on the trigger of his Mauser. It would have surely led to the death of one of them, had he not tilted his body and hid his right hand behind.\n\n'Uh... you go first.' He moves away from the corridor.\n\n'What are you doing here? Scouting around?' The Hui man moved only his lips.\n\n'Otherwise, I would not spend a second in this ruin.' Yang tries to smile, in an attempt to give the man a good impression. 'What is your mission? Blowing up a tank? Your tiny explosive would barely scratch its paint off. American stuff. You better run the second you shoot, lest DPs shred you into tiny bits.'\n\n'Huh, not so emotionless.' The Hui man silently walks past him, yet he turns such that he is always facing Yang.

The absolute length people go through to essentially playing house. At least that's what I thought.\n\nTurns out there are a few merits. She holds speech sometimes and she truly does it like Gao Gang. Motivations and all that. One thing I found amusing is how everything somehow eventually links back to Marx and Bukharin even in this hour. Idealogues, that's what they are.\n\nOh, and speaking of idealogues, I must mention what happened to a fellow group of students who lived next door. I'm not so sure what do they study, but I assume something West related because they are surely ardent supporters of Free China. If you don't know what they are, they distribute newspapers on a daily basis. Though most people use them to wrap hot food and other things, there are readers out there.\n\nA lot of them, but most are far off. I guess what captures their mind is the amount of criticism towards the current regime. One can learn a thing or two from Mr. Lei, but it is just too much. Paints an image where everyone is miserable and what they propagate is the true avenue to liberty. I don't find much difference between them and the Communists, but apparently, they despise each other. They made protests against the Soviet and are immediately made to do all the cleaning under the threat of stopping food rations. Oh, by the way, the League also has an elaborate name for it. 'Reformation of capitalistic elements through labour'. The guys handling telegraphs must hate Communism a lot.\n\nIt's still relatively peaceful. The Soviet made a decision to go out and peacefully protest against the Ningxia rebels and perhaps out of the need to give themselves goodwill they simply watched. Me and my new friends already made several good runs to buy out as many supplies for the students as we can while the rebels were distracted. I think the situation won't last long."

A simple Tibetan village unfolds at the end of the tiny road.\n\n'Noble guest I see! You come by the name of...?' The local Tusi comes forth from a monastery, its walls well kept and its bells shiny. The man bows slightly, speaking almost perfect Chinese, yet he appears wary of Kang and his soldiers, and his arms firmly hidden behind the sleeves of his great Yak-hide coat.\n\n'Nothing more, I come for treasures of old.' Kang Sheng swiftly springs down from the truck and made sure to make a big noise with the bags tied to his belt filled with silver coins of the Republic. 'Those things, you can't maintain them forever in these land with so little tools and resources. I trust you are wise to extract value out of these artefacts.'\n\nThe Tusi looked down and contemplated. He sighs before leading the intruder to the monastery. Essence burns as slow as Kang carefully treads through the carpeted interior. Finely decorated human skulls almost spooked him. Reflecting the dim candle lights, these pieces of Tibetan art seems to have been carefully greased just recently, and the lack of dust on the piece of cloth on top of which the skulls are stored shows great care these creepy artefacts receive.\n\n'You may desire something else, Han.' the Tusi spoke, out of a strange tone, 'if it wasn't for its age, I would have well disposed of it.' He lifts a piece of red cloth hiding something from Kang's view, and there he sees it. 'One of the finest, that's what they say. Made out of... I guess you should know.'\n\nThe human skin Thangka was no ordinary decoration. Kang Sheng couldn't tell much whether it came from a man or a woman, but he feels investigating such things surely drive him insane. On top of the Thangka was an intricate pattern, and in the middle of it lay a figure. A God-King of some Tibetan mythology, Kang thought. Kang perhaps felt true disturbance for the first time in his life out in the West. But this novelty is what drives him."

I think when I grow up, I don't want to be married like Mama is. Mama is always angry with Papa for some reason, but now she is even sadder! I don't want to be sad everyday. Papa left me with that nice Aunty Chen before he left. She's very nice, and her soup and candies taste as good, too. But ever since the building collapsed, she never visited me! I'm not really happy, but I think she has to give other kids candy too, so she's probably away somewhere else.'\n\n'I found some other children with me to play at my place. We've been hiding here ever since the baddies tried to take over the town! We have been playing house and lots of other things. I taught one of the smaller children how to write characters! I think I could be a teacher one day. Or maybe a writer. Papa says they are all respectable folk and everyone listens to them. I will write a big story and everyone would give me money, so I can buy fancy lollies for me and for the aunty to give to more children!'\n\nThe children stopped again, but before she could continue, the sounds of heavy leather boots disrupted her thoughts. The door was slammed open, suddenly waking all other children sleeping on bunk beds and on chairs placed next to each other. An army officer rushes in and forcibly turns off the lamp, at the girl's great displeasure."
 tmm.maclique.87.d:0 "Great news! Communist militia and regulars stationed all over Qinghai gathered themselves into two small forces and just broke through enemy lines from the west and east! Although relatively small due to the constant need for garrison, recent days of reinforcement from the united front have significantly if not completely negated the advantage Ningxia troops initially held. The Martial Law Command recommends we start a general counteroffensive in the next few days."
 tmm.maclique.88.d:0 "If it's his first time on the job, he would have well given up and left. Since his graduation from Xining, this has been one of the numerous cases he'd handled. He faces the dying and the injured more than the living and the merry. People often praise Dr. Shi for his calmness while dealing with all this madness, Shi, however, would suggest alcohol is the best doctor, for it lacks fear or emotions enough to care about anything that would otherwise break him.\n\nNow even that comfort is but a fading memory. Eating and sleeping with his patients, Dr. Shi is not motivated even by the recovery of the wounded, and has always been in a chronic, depressive state. Even as the night grows dark, instead of the annoying avians of Qinghai, groans of the soldiery fill their stead. Other than that, he could hear no sounds. Dr. Shi reckons he'd be used to it as background noise when falling asleep soon, and everyone'd treat him as a psychopath after it's all over for it.\n\nHe's taken over the janitor's room as a temporary residence. Books, records, and shelves stacked high up to the ceiling, creating a stressful and imposing environment in which he could barely even rest his mind. Staring at the records, Dr. Shi's memory suddenly traces back to one of the patients he's looked after earlier today. A native of Nanjing, he could tell with his speech. Sent in around afternoon, shocked by mortar rounds. His mental state was extremely unstable, and Dr. Shi reckon he was insane. He began rambling about how he'd picked up 'memory' of his time in the Qilian Mountains. Says he'd met the Japs. About how they are sent from the heavens. Their skins cannot be penetrated by bullets, and they could summon lightning upon the Chinese. The only thing true he said is the Japs are way more terrifying than the Ningxia soldiery.\n\nIf it was the norm, he would have forgotten about it. But that speech of Jiangnan brings his thoughts back to Nanjing, the mother city he'd have no memory of whatsoever, as if a 6-year-old would remember anything, at all. His thoughts fade, as he prays these evil days to soon pass."
 tmm.maclique.89.d:0 "Even as the town devolves into anarchy, the news is still being churned out at an even faster pace. In wars, everything is worth mentioning, and Free China has continued its operation from southern barracks ever since its eruption here in Golmud.\n\nAlthough many equipment were lost, facilities destroyed and reporters conscripted, it barely scratched the earnestness of the devotees of Zhengxuexi. Even as most lose their lifelong assets, newspaper and magazines are still being sold. Many are still confused about the war. Who's in it, and what caused it. It is said one of the few things that equalise the classes are the newspapers, and people support Free China just as much as they did before the war. Of course, all the profits minus operational costs are sent right back to the civilian, as a gesture of appreciation of their continued work.\n\nFree China has always advocated for a 'different, proper way' of telling stories, ever has it stood steadfast in defending the freedom of news and objective comments on events. But many readers have also pointed out biases, especially towards the United Front. While it has been complained against, the agency kept their style of writing articles.\n\nEarly in the morning, a dozen Ningxia Huis approached the temporary office and criticised the Free China for dehumanising the people of Ningxia and demanded an explanation. Instead, they were declared 'rotting reactionaries' and thrown out with words.\n\nLei just finished his speech with the citizens and he immediately made for Free China, devoting every single second of his life towards his cause. While the crowds still gathered, Lei Zhen has informed the newspaper meant to be delivered out yesterday was never sent out. Surrounded by agitated people, Lei's mood was further lowered upon learning it. He dashes into the office and demands to have a look at what was the deal. Examining the script given to him by one of the editors, Lei reportedly murmured words including 'freedom of speech' and 'freedom of reporting'. He looks for his reading glass but soon realised it was not necessary.\n\nLarge strokes of black ink covered portions of the script. Compared with the original copy he'd written, certain words and phrases seem to have been... circled, or straight-up painted over with. Noises of argument still flood through doors and windows constantly, but Lei Zhen felt something was wrong. And delved into thought."
 tmm.maclique.90.d:0 "The Chengdong road lay empty save for debris from trashed buildings and broken power cables panting out sparkles every now and then, spooking those who yet roam the area. Amidst the charade of glass and pebbles, an old man moves slowly, carefully treading his path as if a hunter in the deep tropics. However, he soon came to a full halt and simply chose to gaze upon the damaged facade of buildings. It soon aroused Ningxia soldiers, but at least this time the rebels wished not to spill blood unnecessarily.\n\n'What are you doing in this wasted place? Are you looking for something? Someone? Don't take us for bands of murderers. We can help you.' proclaimed a Han soldier, advancing ahead of his league of Han and Hui soldiers.\n\n'I-I'm looking for a place, really. Not that you may be aware of. Only a few... insiders around the town would know of it.' In a dismissive tone, the old man swings his walking stick around slightly. The soldier is clearly unhappy, yet he chooses to continue.\n\n'Whatever you are looking for it wouldn't be here. People have fled to the south or to the north, and their homes would be utterly abandoned, or even mined! A few days earlier one of the Kuomintang blew himself up. His body yet remains there. We can't assist you to southern parts of the town, but if you wish so we could spare some food and water.' The soldier said.\n\n'But you are mistaken! I can see it right here! Nanjing Road, here it is! Its glory laid low and its owners emptied. Battered brick walls falling upon screaming columns of refugees. That is what I am looking for. And just a few dozen metres from here, look! Zhonghua! Can't you all see it, the beating heart of the City-Upon-Hills? I can almost see the flaming high-rises, flakes of burnt newspaper waltzing with demons of King Yanluo!'\n\n'Now wait a minute, old man! Don't I am too illiterate to know meanings of your words.' Agitated, the Ningxia soldier sprang onto the old man till he was barely a metre away, yet the old man did not move by an inch. 'You pronounce many tragedies, yet few if not none of them have to do with us! We are saving the Republic! It has grown old, weary, and incompetent. it would only come to harm all of us!'\n\nThe soldier angrily attempts to correct his opponent. The old man steps back a bit, and raises his right hand, palm facing outwards in a short gesture."
 tmm.maclique.91.d:0 "Alarming development! As we have mostly put the situation on the Qilian Mountains on a lower priority and let the Xining Command do their job, it seems that despite being unable to crack our codes yet, General Tsuji has noticed a decrease in communication. Aircrafts attached to the Homengun took off from Lanzhou and already began several rounds of bombardment against our positions. The enemy attack was ineffective as our forward positions detected and warned of the attack and no one was injured or killed. However, the prospect of what might come after it is enough to drive President Ma Jiyuan insomniac."
 tmm.maclique.92.d:0 "I thought it would get better sooner or later, but it seems I was a bit too optimistic on those matters. \n\nI don't really know what happened, as I was gathering food with all the few hundred cartridge shells we got. We ran into a quagmire of blood and bodies, I can't put it in any other way. I think I was gonna vomit, and some others. The Ningxia brutes saw us, but overall we weren't hurt, but we found ourselves with barely half of what we initially bought when we crashed into the front doors of our dormitory.\n\nThe general secretary girl didn't speak for a whole hour or so, a record as far as I am aware, till she made suggestions to at least ask them to bring back the bodies and find a place to bury them. I wasn't present as I was cleaning blood off my shoes and dress with Little Xiao, but apparently, they demanded more ration for it to happen. We only got the names of those poor souls at the end, but at the very least we could mourn over them. Surprisingly, though, their bodies were gone this morning. I assume they still have some sanity, after all.\n\nWe made a discussion about the whole incident, and in the beginning, no one spoke. It wasn't until the general secretary girl spoke did the entire hall burst into cries, mummers, and screams. These tragic circumstances draw too much rage and anguish, yet we couldn't really do much with what we have. I think someone was scorned for saying it would relieve the supply issue, but I can't really tell who was it.\n\nAnyways, I guess out of dark, Darwinist remarks there are some merits. It is easier for us to survive when there are fewer mouths to feed. I'll try to make the most out of it so that their sacrifice for themselves and for all those trapped shall not be in vain. For my evil thoughts, I am writing the names of all the fallen in respect so to ease my mind and those around me."
 tmm.maclique.93.d:0 "'I must admit, my reckless actions have many unexpected consequences, many of which have proven to have several negative impacts on the party and the organisation.'\n\nZhao solemnly spoke, against what seems to be a silent, invisible wall of atonement.\n\n'I recognise it has created a new impression of the Party, which is likely to affect how work is carried out here and elsewhere in Qinghai in an undesirable way. And now I have come to you, Comrade General Secretary as Lian Po did. I do not ask for pardons, only what I deserve.'\n\n'Indeed it has been! Letters are flowing into the central committee. Now out of all possible times! Think how much work and effort could have been undone. Further, not all dissents protest openly. One must understand beneath the surface, chances of evil and reaction could well sow seeds of rebellion. Sooner or later. It would have thwarted many preparations me and the comrades in the politburo made' The General Secretary spoke, his two arms arched on the vermilion table, supporting his chin.'\n\nZhao remains silent, for he awaits what judgment comes down from the General Secretary.\n\n'But for someone like you, well-versed in the rules and guidelines of the Party, you should recognise me summoning you is no usual procedures of punishment. Isn't it, Comrade Zhao?'\n\nA rather stiff atmosphere reigns in the room.\n\n'Let me put it in a different way. Here's something future generations leaders like you might have a use, one day. Understand this, these media, especially in the hands of Americans are indeed regrettable, but the current situation demands me and you to focus on what is ongoing and that is a war. An open war. Seek reprimands not, nor redemption. You have enemies to kill and a nation to win. When a general wages war, none may lord over him, Comrade Zhao.'"
 tmm.maclique.94.d:0 "'These fools, ah, I had them all within my grasp! I thought I would break cover somehow, but I guess that was needless thought. Could've done something else! You have no idea how many backup plans I made with Aiqin these days.' Liu Shaoqi is in a rather good mood, strange for one trapped in a city under constant shelling and street fighting. The only one with him is his old chauffeur, though the latter feels not the joy as he does. Liu feels the chauffeur is gripping the steering wheel tightly. He leans forward and pats the man's right shoulder.\n\n'You don't need to worry. Gao gang wears the same pants as I do. Ching-kuo is my friend, too. They wouldn't dare to touch you or me.'\n\n'Ah, I wouldn't say the same with these soldiers if I was you, sir.' The chauffeur points to the checkpoint ahead, with troops already pouring out, demanding documents. Before Liu Shaoqi could even say a thing, one of the guards seems to have recognised him on the spot. 'Hey, isn't this the supposedly far-right traitor Liu Shaoqi? He defected to the Ningxia and helped them against us! Don't let him pass unchecked!' The Guard yells. Before Liu Shaoqi could say something in defense, the guards grabbed him, the leading man yelling in his face about sending him to the south to be court-martialed.\n\nBefore even the guards are aware, a few military trucks suddenly approached the checkpoint from behind them, bearing the insignia of the NRA. A dozen troops wearing M35 stahlhelms exited them quickly and began shouting something in Cantonese to the guards, brewing great confusion. It was not until one man spoke did the chaos end.\n\n'Stop it all! Look at you, arguing harder than you'd fight the enemy. Set the two free at once!' Chiang Ching-kuo's presence immediately set a sense of fear into the guards, as they grudgingly let go of Liu Shaoqi and stood by, their heads lowered.\n\n'Comrade Shaoqi! We have been waiting for you for a while. You have made great efforts in sabotaging our enemy, yet bound by our own men in such dishonour! I hope you aren't hurt.' Gao gang emerges from the shadows from nowhere, almost triggering one man to draw his pistol before being taken away by the presidential guards.\n\n'Not enough to scratch me, that is.Quick, we have much to talk about.' said Liu Shaoqi, as the trio quickly make their way into the back of one truck together with Shaoqi's chauffeur and their men, disappearing as suddenly as they showed up."
 tmm.maclique.95.d:0 "With the last gold their family can spare, it appears Ma Dunjing has recruited some homeless men to his cause.

 tmm.maclique.97.d:0 "The ever-thining smoke raising from Golmud can be seen from afar, signaling travelers of ill news from the capital of Qinghai. Yet a serpentine cloud of sand and coarse rocks moves towards the settlement engulfed in brotherly wars. Beneath several layers of old army quilts stuffed with whatever he could find, Kang Sheng returns from his days in Tibet, triumphant and with many assets. A dash for the Southern Barracks is what Kang hoped for, believing these areas should be well sheltered under the flying red banners, yet another band of men wielding the same red flags stopped his little convoy of treasures.\n\n'Shut your engines and stay still! Who am I looking at?' A group of riders approaches Kang's vehicle from the right, its leader wielding a megaphone shouting into the dry air, their silhouettes twisted by heat. Kang tries to order his driver to maneuver beyond them, but the warning rounds from the riders force him to stop, not wanting even a dent on what he'd collected.\n\n'I am but a traveler of lands, with no ill intentions!' Kang shouts, but hides his guards in the covered flatbed while talking to the cavalrymen.\n\n'I know your kind, Communists!' The leader spat. 'You believe in no god, and make empty promises! I won't trust a word out of your damned mouth unless I have a sword on your petty neck! So much for trust, I give you one more chance to speak the truth.'\n\n'Oh, so you are now accusing us of lacking goodwill?' laughed Kang Sheng. 'Look at yourselves! You claim yourself master warriors, yet for all your courage, bravery, and faith you have no intellect. Mindless!' The Hui man immediately drew his Mosin-Nagant, pointing at Kang Sheng between his eyes, yet the latter kept pronouncing their misdeeds. 'We had a deal. A great plan. What did your master Dunjing do? Screw it over a woman! Our troops are now being disarmed by the NRA, and our leadership under Liu Shaoqi barely gets to decide where our men go! If there is distrust, you are amongst the first offenders.'\n\nThe Hui man seems confused, as his companions did. They proceed to murmur to each other, nodding their heads, and look back at him every now and then. Before they could reach a conclusion though, the leading Hui man finds a little bag shoved at him from the Communist.\n\n'As a token of... my genuine support, here's a sum of coins enough for half a month for you all. Kang Sheng boards his truck, waving towards the soldiers as he departs the scene."
 tmm.maclique.98.d:0 "Dust raised, and the roads craked. Crewing a Stuart himself, Chiang Wei-kuo scrutinises the advancing column of tanks and armoured vehicles down the road. The noise of such engines alone is sufficient to rouse great attention, and its shiny guns and machine guns only invite more awe. Even they are considered ridiculously outdated by the world, a veteran of the shameful Second World War may yet redeem itself in servitude to the Republic-in-exile. Wei-kuo's armoured force arrives at the temporary command, welcomed by none other but Ching-kuo. Within a few minutes, the former is striding with his elder brother along the concrete walls, newly painted with giant, red characters.\n\n'I am most impressed by the performances of the 200th. Small, but effective.' Ching-kuo seems to be trying to invite Wei-kuo's attention, who has been all but too disconnected from the family and focused on his projects as soon as American aids touched Chinese soil, 'if all Chinese men could be armed and trained as such, we'd never be in this ramshackle of a province.'\n\n'Indeed. It has been rather unfortunate I have yet to extend what I've seen and learned to our forces. It wouldn't be as effective, but I do expect in the long run they shall act as the seeds, from which great timber shall arise.' Wei-kuo is yet to drift his eyes from a yellowed, folded book, revealing a pedigree of troops and organisations.\n\n'Ah, well. I suppose that German education still runs in your mind, after all these years.'\n\n'The Germans are on a thoroughly different plane, brother.' Wei-kuo seems to have finished with his business, for the time being, inserting it back into his pocket. He then proceeds to swivel his arms behind his back.\n\n'I've been to Austria, Poland too. And I have learned things beyond waging war. The machines! Can you comprehend it? Their weaponry is powerful yet its inner workings enigmatic. From those adventures, I saw streamlined processes of maintenance, communication, and tactics. From that day I learned courage is often belittled by intricate planning.\n\n'Lacking are our plans and thoughts. And so we are here, left to rot in Qinghai.' Ching-kuo sighs.\n\n'And that is why I was there. The same reason I am here now, brother. To arm ourselves and train endlessly are insufficient. One or two brains aren't enough.'"
 tmm.maclique.99.d:0 "Disturbing news comes from the faraway front! Seeing a lack of response on our part, General Tsuji has launched several company-sized raiding forces into our defensive line! While they have achieved little against our carefully planned out fortifications, both sides suffered casualties. Our scouts report they are at all times capable of suppressing an entire regiment of NRA troops or even more, and only by brilliant counteroffensives and well-placed traps are the Japs driven back. But with them, the information of us also spreads. A leader known for his intelligence, Tsuji will arm his men and instruct them accordingly. If he comes again, the chances of us surviving a full-on assault are low, to say the least."
 tmm.maclique.100.d:0 "Golmud has always been known to have rather extreme temperature differences. While the earth would be scorchingly hot for most of the year, as soon as the sun falls below the horizon, the frost is unbearable even for those from Dongbei. And as such, most plants that endure the extremes often end up developing a significant amount of dew before evaporating away, a fact utilised by many.\n\nBut even before the Sun comes to life, troops are marching out from the mustering grounds, carrying out their daily duty. While many are still in slumber, General Zhang Fakui and Mu Shengzhong have been awake for an extended period of time, overseeing organisation and plans of defense. Zhang spoke a lot less recently, but none dares to ask him why.\n\n'General Zhang still has a few tricks up in his sleeves, after all these long years! Look at them, armies of the world would compete for these recruits, their spirit high and their quality excellent.' Mu applauds, giving Zhang a pat on his back. He knows of the concerns that have since filled Zhang's heart but chose to praise him in an indirect attempt to relieve him somewhat.\n\n'A man cannot lay his enemy to waste, if he is without a brain. As per Mr. Ching-kuo's suggestions, we'd need a deep defense. Their nimble cavalry is certainly not an amusing sight.' said Zhang.\n\n'Your thoughts reach indeed afar. Many on the streets, including many of mine own officers, are saying you are one of the most capable defenders, yet you rarely engaged enemies in full-scale attacks.' said Mu, jokingly.\n\n'Ah! But they'd be too young to witness my exploits, General! When I was in the South, even those of Wu Peifu, the mightiest of all Zhili warlords fear my relentless assaults. Those were the old times. Though fierce, I'd say the battle here at Golmud can be barely described as intense.'\n\n'Speaking of these events. I have always wondered...You have commanded fierce battles, each step you brought great fear into the hearts of Japanese aggressors, and each time you made them bleed for every inch of land they took. Though throughout your action, which one you'd say to be the most demanding and dangerous?' asked Mu, as if a son asking a father of his accounts. 'I'd reckon Cho...'\n\n'Liuzhai. There is no doubt about it.'"

Many evil deeds were done, yet it bogs on. Due to the increase in casualties, the city has lost a significant chunk of its pre-war population, either killed or have fled since. What hopes both sides had in engaging open wars quickly died down, as the fronts melt away into gruesome, and often dirty ambushes, encirclements, and betrayals. Outside of the bloody slums, ironically, it is thought to be much safer to wander on the streets, as long as the civilians make their presence known before making every turn to belligerents.\n\nSome citizens are now making their way outside, out of livelihood, or something else. No matter, the city is slowly being dragged from incapacitation, as the people voluntarily started cleaning up the debris. Not wanting to be seen as the bad side, both the Ningxia troops and the NRA held their fire and unofficially allowed life to come back to the streets. Already, areas behind the front are said to be inhabited once more, though those who occupy their homes once again are no longer the same. While some lament for the loss of their life-long earnings, most activities are carried out in unison, perhaps out of the Chinese's love for order from their very bones.\n\nAs a group of thirty people made their way to clean up the streets of concrete debris, one man accidentally triggered a mortar round yet to explode. Immediately the victim was sent into the air, landing heavily half a dozen metres away, with concrete pieces he meant to remove landing on his legs. \n\nMistaking the explosion for a full-on shootout, most immediately fled in terror hiding behind in alleys. The man was left in agony for minutes till men in their fifties rushed out, cleared the debris, and dragged him away, leaving behind a trail of blood as they fly."

The story is based in a world far different from that of reality. In the alternate timeline, Mao Zedong of Hunan became the leader of the Chinese Communist Party instead of Wang Ming. Under Mao's leadership, a highly efficient, organised, and tolerant Communist Party manages to ally with Chiang in repulsing the Japanese Empire, and later defeating Chiang in uniting China under one red banner. Mobilising the unused potential of China with modernised, democratic, and grassroot government, China emerges as a beacon of socialism and welfare. The protagonist Wang eventually finds his love and dream job in Shenyang and goes on to return to his village and use what he gained to benefit his townsmen.\n\nCritics describe the book as 'as outlandish as it is earthly', noting its incorporation of cultural references while arguing against the possibility of a Communist victory. Even amidst the Communist Party itself, there are mixed opinions. While many reject the possibility of Mao's victory, more are speaking about the good qualities of Mao and characters in the book, arguing the main theme of the book is advocating for democratisation, honesty, and efficiency in general, and Mao merely acted as a vessel for such ideas."

Just a few dozen kilometres out and the very existence of the city would have been unknown to the nomads.\n\nAlongside him were Zhang Xunfeng, his wife, and his children. The kids made lots of complaints due to the bumpy track, but their protest soon dies down as Zhang brings them to sleep. Days of insomnia and high altitude are taking a toll on her body. She feels hear brain burns as if screaming for rest, yet she has not the heart nor the condition to. Ma Jiyuan has remained mostly silent, and she's afraid if provoked he'd unleash his anger and desperation unto her. And so the couple remained speechless, and the cracking sound of gravel and pieces of asphalt dominated for many kilometres.\n\n'Even in your darkest dreams, have you ever thought of what would become of us... like this?' Jiyuan broke the silence abruptly, catching Xunfeng off guard.\n\n'Well...  no, not really. That war, it was so sudden... I'm glad at least non of us were hurt, unlike many other unlucky people.' Xunfeng replies, stopping every now and then, choosing her words carefully. 'You've done all you can. In our darkest hour, you have given us and the Republic hope and purpose. The people have found their leader, why does it matter if it wasn't you? Leave the perfidious to themselves! No matter what they say, they know from their hearts that the savior was none other than President Ma Jiyuan. Now that you are free, perhaps this is the hour in which you return to the family.'\n\n'You're right on that part. I have spent more time sorting paper than raising my children as my father did. What would happen to me if I do not have someone like you... I can only admit I do not know.' said Jiyuan. 'I only hope that we can adjust ourselves easily in Lhasa, and our children may be free of any harm.'\n\n'Speaking of that, what would become of the Ma Family? I fear they won't stop just now. The very thought of it puts me restless.' Uttered Xunfeng.\n\n'That is definite. We will suffer, but I do not think the Kuomintang or the Communists are of that sort.'\n\n'Alas! Don't listen to me.'"
 tmm.maclique.109.d:0 "GOLMUD - Large swaths of Ningxia Bandit Army supporters storm the Legislative Yuan yesterday. Motivated by separatism, false promises and financed by remnants of Ningxia traitors, around one thousand congregated and maliciously blocked routine businesses of the capital of the Republic of China in a vile attempt to disrupt legislative processes and efforts of legislators to rebuild Golmud and Qinghai from the devastating civil war instigated by Bandit-Traitor Ma Dunjing. A standoff ensued between local garrison and protestors, including a large portion of university students and workers, who had been led by a small core of Ningxia rebels to stand against government forces.\n\nInitially, the protest was peaceful and despite the presence of protestors, the situation was not particularly noteworthy. However, the masses were provoked by the malicious instigators, who went to great lengths in directly assaulting the legitimacy of the National Government and belittling the critical role that the United Front played in defeating the Ningxia Rebellion, one that has led to many death and tragedy in Qinghai. In stead, the crowds were told that the conflict 'was partially caused by the actions of the National Government', and shifted the blame to the defenders of the Republic.\n\nInspired by speeches made by the agitators, the Military Police clashed heavily with protestors. After roughly forty minutes of struggle, the conflict died down around 4 PM. Many have fled the scene, but more are surrounded by military and police personnel to be screened before they are allowed to leave the area.\n\nAt least 100, including many of the leaders and organisers of the violent protests, have been detained. Despite the intensity, the law enforcement showed great restraint, and no one from either side was severely injured. Several legislative representatives call for peace. and calmness after the incident. The Presidential Office, the Yuan, and neither party have yet to make any comments on the incident."

He was killed by a machine gun barrage assaulting an enemy position.'\n\n 'Dismissed.' Jiyuan waved the soldier away without another thought, intent on viewing the body alone. His fingers stiffened. He took a deep breath, and, inch by inch, peeled away the linen covering.\n\n Ma Chongede's bloated face stared back at him. His body was covered in bullet wounds and slathered in dried blood. He'd been left in the street for days- his body was decaying, and a miasma of rotting meat surrounded the young man's corpse. Flies buzzed about Chongede's head like a squirming halo. But worst of all was the terrible sense that Jiyuan's cousin had been reduced to an object. There was a quality to him now, a stiff, plastic quality that left him devoid of humanity, an object to be manipulated and nothing more. Where there was once a human being, a disrespectful, foul-mouthed jackass who spent more time in the brothel than in his marriage bed, there was now a lump of rotting meat.\n\n Ma Jiyuan reached for his cousin's face, brushing away a swarm of flies, and cradled Chongede's rotting cheek in his hand. 'I'm so sorry, cousin,' he said. A sob began to build in his chest. 'I'm so sorry you never grew into the man you should have been.'\n\n Jiyuan stood, swallowing his tears, choking back a mouthful of vomit. 'Woe to us, that we should lose even our family.'"
 tmm.maclique.111.d:0 "Reportee: Wang Yaozu, Lieutenant, 84th Division\nReport Date: D+13\n\nOn D+13, Elements of the 26th Infantry Company (Note: For external press, please refer to the unit as 'Certain elements of the 84th Division') stationed in northern Golmud conducted mopping operations against remnants of Ningxia traitor hideouts. Surveillance was placed onto suspected holdouts by elements of the NSB under command of Lieutenant Colonel |REDACTED|. Reconnaissance conducted five days prior to the assault, confirming previously held suspicions.\n\n8th Section engaged suspected enemy position with rifle grenades, immediately following a charge against suspected enemy positions. Ningxia rebels opened fire, causing two (2) riflemen to be shot in the groin (1 heavily wounded, still in dangerous condition) and one (1) in the right arm joint. Section commander and submachine gun gunner however successfully counter-suppressed enemy fire, killing four (4) rebels and wounding one (1). Three (3) enemies were bayoneted by charging 7th Section in ensuing close quarter combat. \n\n1st Section was the most successful, due to them being almost solely armed with handguns and submachine guns. In a roughly 15 minute skirmish, the section suffered only one (1) injured, which in turn incurred five (5) casualties amongst the enemy, two (2) of which were mortally wounded. In future operations, an additional allocation of close-quartered weaponry should be permitted, and personnel should be trained with such weaponry in tight corridors to prepare for future engagements. Before reconstruction, it is ideal to use ruined structures as training ground.\n\nIn total four (4) enemies were wounded, and 9 (nine) were killed. Additional ten (10) rebel forces surrendered upon complete encirclement.\n\nExtraneous incident: Private Ma Fuguo of the 1st section discovered a (1) boy stuck in a collapsed building. Private Ma rescued said boy and was shot in the chest while it was being undertaken. Both are in stable condition and have been hurried into field hospitals."

 tmm.maclique.66.d:0 "The war has finally ended. Although a few dozen are still on the run, the majority of enemy forces have been annihilated. In a climactic ending, an artillery shell landing in a makeshift munition depot within the Northern Barrack brought a quarter of the installation to utter ruination, with Ma Dunjing himself reduced to atoms. With the rebels put down, proscription of Ma Clique leaders, their families and rebelling soldiers are being carried out with brutal efficiency. Within three days, the Ma Clique ceased to be an effective combat force.\n\nHowever, with the common enemy gone, whether the United Front can survive is no longer a question. It is only a question of time."
