portrait_picker.1.d:0 "Shukshin sat at his table jotting notes for his upcoming speech. This speech was special, for the first time in a while he intended to change his uniform. Throughout his presidency, some of his public relations advisors expressed their concerns over his overly simple outfit. To appease this surprisingly vocal group, he’d try out something different for a change. Sending for his tailor, he waited until he finally arrived.\n\n'So what’ll it be, Mr. President?'"
portrait_picker.1.a:0 "I'll stick with my classic look, Well known, I think."
portrait_picker.1.b:0 "Dress to impress! Give me my coat and sunglasses!"
portrait_picker.1.c:0 "The people respect a strong leader. I think i'll grow some facial hair."
portrait_picker.1.e:0 "I have to look professional and clean. Pull that nice black suit out."
