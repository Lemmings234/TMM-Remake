 IRC_russia.1.t:0 "A Visitor from Tehran"
 IRC_russia.1.desc:0 "To Olga, working at the diplomatic office as a receptionist was a good affair. She wasn't privy to all of the things the Russian government did, nor was she given any special clearance. That was fine with her, to be frank. While Olga was a downright polyglot, capable in a number of local and global languages alike, and politely proficient in many more, she wasn't in subterfuge. So, far away from the trickery of diplomacy - or rather, spying, Olga was happy in her desk to greet the distinguished visitors to her home.\n\nThis wasn't to say she was clueless. When the doors opened to an olive-skinned man in a simple suit, a rather handsome one at that, she smiled and welcomed him in, but knew better than to reveal state secrets, for that matter.\n\n"Dobro pozhalovat, welcome to the Federation's Diplomatic Reception. My name is Olga, how may I assist you?" she asked in her kindest voice. The man took of his hat - bowed in such an adorable way - smiled and responded in perfect Russian.\n\n"Thank you for such a kind salutation. I have a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in about an hour? Ah, I am Mr. Ardeshir Zahedi. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Olga." Zahedi... sounded Iranian. What a cutie, and so polite, and he knew Russian? Olga eagerly checked the schedule and saw a meeting for a Mister Zahedi, but in an hour. She hated making people wait, but an hour was simply too early.\n\nOlga spoke now in her fluent Farsi. "Mr. Zahedi, I'm so sorry, but Mr. Sultan isn't scheduled to see you for at least another hour," she regrettably explained. Zahedi smiled warmly and leaned chuckled. "It is I who must apologize. Arriving early is terribly rude, especially when my hostess is so kind to me, to speak in my language. Do you know much of Iran?" he asked. Olga thought about it a bit, she knew a bit, but enough to know that she wasn't as well-versed in its history as she'd like to be. So, seeing Mr. Zahedi was kind, handsome, an expert in the subject, and full of time to kill, she smiled broadly.\n\n"Not enough Mr. Zahedi, why don't you tell me?" she offered. With a bit of a thought, Zahedi began, "Your people have helped us so tremendously in making a republic similar to yours, and I came to say my thanks. Let me tell you of the Qajars, to start.""
