  KMC_CountryInfo_Folder.101: "The Fate of the Pacific Fleet"

  KMC_CountryInfo_Content.1: "The Past"
  KMC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "In the ensuing chaos following the collapse of the §GSoviet Union§! we found ourselves the last remaining Fleet, with §BArkhangelsk, Leningrad and all ports on the Black Sea§! falling to the fascist invader we remained the sole inheritor of the proud Soviet Naval Tradition. Pledging our loyalty to §RYagoda’s§! regime, as the legitimate continuation of the USSR we served for a time from §GVladivostok§! continuing routine maritime patrol missions and guarding the ever decreasing Russian shipping coming in and out of our ports."

  KMC_CountryInfo_Content.2: "The Situation"
  KMC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "With the §RJapanese§! backed invasion of the Far East by their Fascist puppets we faced a stark choice, fight and die or preserve what was left of the fleet. With no prospect of victory in the face of the overwhelming power of the §RJapanese Navy§!, §BAdmiral Ivan Yumashev§! made the decision to evacuate north to the Kamchatka Peninsula. Basing ourselves out of the then mostly abandoned port of §GPetropavlovsk-Kamchatsky§!, the small port down has gradually grown with our presence."

  KMC_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Unfortunate Circumstances"
  KMC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "Without the support of a larger government the prospect of maintaining even our small navy became more difficult. With a small population, no industry to speak of and no outside support we had no other option than to turn to §YPiracy and Smuggling§!. \n\nNow a sad excuse for a navy the warships rarely raid themselves, instead preferring to operate from converted fishing, or cargo vessels to avoid suspicion, with the warships often found sitting in port, rusting and slowly falling apart. As our ships decay so do the spirits of the men. Over time more and more of our veterans perished or left of their own accord, often making off with one of our ships to operate on their own out of another village elsewhere in the peninsula, refusing to hand over their loot to the good of the fleet. What is left is a band of the aging old guard, and young men and boys who have often only joined the fleet to escape crushing poverty, hoping to chance their luck on a raid or aboard a smuggling ship. "

  KMC_CountryInfo_Content.4: "The Future"
  KMC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "There are those in the fleet who hope for change however, §BVeteran Admiral Grigory Shchedrin§! and devout §RCommunist, Captain Ivan Maslennikov§! believe that the fleet must rebuild its §YProfessional Core§! and reignite its spirit as a defender of the Soviet Motherland. Should they wish to achieve their goals, it will be necessary to rely on, or even increase our efforts towards §YPiracy and Smuggling§! if they hope to fund this.\n\n==FEATURES==\n\n*Address the decaying standard of §YProfessionalism§! in the Fleet.\n\n*Conduct §YPiracy and Smuggling§! to keep what is left of the Navy afloat.\n\n*Find a way out of Kamchatka to reassert the Navy as a significant force in Russia again!"

  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.1: "Operation Ichi-Go"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "The Chinese Theatre of the Imperial Japanese Army has been §Ynot the mode ideal§!. Although Chinese offensives have been largely halted, Japan is unwilling, nor able to wage large-scale assaults after §Rsustaining heavy casualties§! in the triple battles for the city of Changsha. This situation would change, however, with the §RBattles of Yu-Xiang-Gui§!, known to the Japanese as the §NTairiku Datsū Sakusen§!, the '§YContinent Cross-Through Operation§!', or more simply Operation Number One.\n\nRallying all mobile forces the IJA can offer, the Empire struck on 17th April 1944 into Henan. Whilst not strictly on the path to Japan-occupied Indochina, Japanese leadership sought to §Yseize the railways§! running from northern China once and for all such that future offensives may be conducted with more troops and supplies. The 1st Military Region, due to a combination of abhorrent levels of corruption and lack of combat experience was §Rswiftly defeated§!, effectively losing the province of Henan."
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Of Shaanxi and Hunan"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "Saying the Generalissimo was enraged by military incompetence was an understatement, but Chiang had other §Rmore pressing issues at hand§!. The IJA once again marched down to Changsha with twice as many as they brought back in 1942, and this time, it was too much for the city. §NJapan§! swiftly took the city, an important railway junction that will serve the army well as it further pushes south. However, the Chinese will not yield the province so lightly, and at the town of §YHengyang§!, one of the most brutal battles of the entire war was fought. Although taking alarming casualties, the strategic importance of Hengyang is §Ystill worth the cost§!.\n\nThe Communists, after losing Yan'an due to the overconfidence of the Politburo, §Yturned to Mao Tse-tung's methods for salvation§!, and during the Japanese push, the Reds §Gonly took a few casualties§! in their operation to expand the “Red Zones” across northern China, to the annoyance of Japan."
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Of Guangxi"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "Affairs in Hunan are mostly over with by July, and in late August the advancing Japanese forces were able to §Yreplenish their losses§! and waged war into the mountainous province of Guangxi. Together with their preexisting forces in Guangdong. Despite stiff resistance, the steady advance of the Japanese army §Rwas not stoppable§!. By early November Guilin and Liuzhou were taken, and within a few weeks, Nanning fell, marking the end of the §YGuangxi Campaign§!.\n\nMeanwhile, coordinating with their comrades further up north, the Japanese garrison in Vietnam seized the opportunity and attacked from the rear, §Rforcing Chinese forces to almost completely abandon the province of Guangxi§!. Japanese forces also made attempts to strike into Guizhou to no avail.\n\nJapan's victory was undoubtedly §Gone of the greatest so far§!, taking multiple important provinces that seriously drained China's ability to continue the war. "
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.4: "1945"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "1945 saw the §Rcapitulation of the Soviet Union§! after years of fighting, but the war in China was still far from over. During the opening months, the IJA was once again held in check by the Chinese defenders §Gat Zhijiang§! and other settlements across western Hunan and Hubei. Chinese forces, now armed with American weapons, §Gtook back cities across Guangxi including Guilin§!. §YIt appears that despite Japan's technological superiority, China shall claim victory§!.\n\nThe notion that the war could be won §Rquickly died down§! after consecutive defeats of Allied forces. §RIndia fell into civil war§!, Australia and Hawaii were at serious risk of a Japanese invasion, in addition to war weariness amongst the westerners. The United States was §Rforced to finally enter peace negotiations§! with the §LGerman Reich§! and the §NJapanese Empire§!. By late August, the West has essentially withdrawn from the war, §Rleaving the Republic of China as the sole combatant against Japan§!."
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.5: "1946"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "Seeing the situation nearly unsalvagable, the Military Commission begrudgingly gave up hope of taking any territories back and sought to §Rfight to whatever end§!, taking as many Japanese with them as possible until §Ywar weariness§! in §NJapan§! brings her down.\n\nUnderstanding the weight of every battle, they only became more bloody as §Rgreat number of human lives were lost§! in the green hills of Guangxi and Guizhou. The §YSecond Battle of Guilin§! saw tens of thousands of Japanese dead as Japan's tanks become increasingly ineffective against the §BNRA§!.\n\nIn the north, the 1st Military Region faces significant issues with loss of faith. Leaders §Rsurrendered en masse§!, resulting in the §Rloss of Xi'an and Tianshui§! in August 1946. \n\nThe Third Battle of Liuzhou finally brought down Guangxi and subsequently much of Guizhou in October, with §Rmore than 140,000 dead from both sides over the course of two months§!."
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.6: "1947"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "§RThe rivers of Guilin might run red§!, but it is still nothing compared to the §YBattle of Sichuan§!, a war waged not with tanks or artilleries, but rather the §Rsheer primordial human instinct of murder and wanton ruination§!. With nothing more to lose, the defenders sought to protect Chongqing as their ancestors did 700 years ago against Mongol invaders.\n\nIt seems however that the Chinese were destined to lose the war. Consecutive days of heavy rain and ensuing floods in June §Rfinally destroyed the Chinese economy§!, already under harsh austerity policies. The flag of the Rising Sun finally §Ytriumphantly enters the devastated city of Chongqing on 4th July 1946§!, with more than a quarter of a million Japanese casualty and well over 1,000,000 Chinese corpses paving the way. Chongqing fell, and with it, China. Chiang's death finally broke what little unity regional leaders had held previously, and the war swiftly ended."

  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7: "People often thought that after the §Rfall of Chongqing§!, the experiment of the §BNational Revolution in China§! §Rfailed§!. The §BRepublic of China§! has §Rfailed§!. The Chinese race has §Rfailed§!, who shall be forever of servitude, under the boots of the Japanese devils. \n\nBeyond the mountainous province of Shanxi, beyond the ancient lands of Gansu §Runder the chains of mad Tsuji§!, beyond traitor §WLong Yun§! and §WHe Guoguang§!'s provinces whose collaboration brings great shame to the lands of the Southwest, one province remains free. Qinghai, once but an empty corner of China, has taken up the §Ghelm of Chinese resistance§!, who §Rshall know no peace§! till the collaborator dogs and their Japanese masters have been driven out. For the men of Qinghai and neighbouring Xikang, the §YWar of Resistance never truly ended§!. Although boasting only 2 million inhabitants, its geographical location and natural barriers made it the §Gleader of the Republic-in-exile§!."

  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.8: "§WMa Jiyuan§!, the sole son of the late §WMa Bufang§! and successor to his legacy of Hui overlordship of all Qinghai, finds himself surrounded on two sides.\n\nTo the south lays the ancient hermit kingdom of §YTibet§!. Nowhere near a regional powerhouse, Tibet's army is still more than enough to match that of Ma's. Furthermore, Tibet has §Ya significant interest§! in further exploiting the collapse of the Republic of China to annex all of Qinghai and Xikang to unite their nation. With their seizure of Yushu back in the 1950s, it is clear if Ma cannot pacify Tibet, §Rthey will strike first§!.\n\nTo the east lays the fiefdom of General §WMasanobu Tsuji§! and his Northwest China Army. A great enemy to both the Chinese and the Free World, Tsuji was one of the masterminds behind §Rthe War§!. The Seihoku Homengun is the direct successor of the North China Expeditionary Army from the War, forming the §REmpire's formidable defence§!."
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content.9: "Internal Struggle"
  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.9: "The Retreat into the Northwest or the Second Long March to the Communists brought with the people the division between them. The hostility between political sects did not dim in the slightest, and in fact, only have grown with the §Ydeath of authoritarian leaders like Chiang Kai-shek§!. It may take just about anything to ignite open conflict.\n\n§WMa Jiyuan§! was proclaimed the new leader after his father's demise at the hand of Japanese bombers, and appointed the first §BExtraordinary President of the Republic of China§!, elevating him to the head of all Anti-Japanese forces that still endure. A temporary constitution was also hurried through by §WChiang Ching-kuo§! and §WLiu Shaoqi§! in order to limit Ma Jiyuan's power while protecting their own \n\nrights. This action ensured Qinghai Ma Clique would never be able to eclipse the §BNational Government§!, but also rendered the province vulnerable to §Rcontinued internal disagreements§!."

  QIN_CountryInfo_Content_desc.10: "Thought to be far less harsh than his father, §WMa Jiyuan§!'s control over the Ningxia Ma Clique §Rwanes further§!.\n\nIn the §YCCP§!, due to Liu's collaboration with the §BKuomintang§!, many became either disillusioned or switched sides. The legislative election in 1960 saw the §YCCP§!, led by §WLiu Shaoqi§!, suffering a crushing defeat, leading to the party ousting §WLiu§! and replacing him with the ambitious §WGao Gang§!, who chose to ally with the President. Under Communist endorsement, §WMa Jiyuan§! grows ever more proactive in politics, drifting out of Kuomintang's grip. \n\nAfter a decade of preparation, Qinghai is finally being organised for a single purpose, but §Rwhether it may survive is still to be seen§!."

  SIC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7: "§GSichuan is the richest and most developed province of all Southwest§!, and since the dawn of the Chinese civilisation it has been known as the §Grice bowl of China§!. Surrounded by formidable ranges of imposing mountains, the small plain that lies within provides food for endless millions of the Middle Kingdom, as well as a wide assortment of goods. Ever since the §YRailway Protection Movement§!, Sichuan has been §Rdivided between various petty warlords§!, each hinging onto their own private armies. Though §WYuan Shikai§! united it, his death also pronounced the doom of a united Sichuan.\n\nGreat chaos and anarchy ensued. By 1917, the situation developed so badly that the military governor of Sichuan §WXiong Kewu§! was forced to create the §YFangqu System§!, giving areas for these troops to 'garrison' in order to subdue the unruly bands of soldiers by giving them special privileges."
  SIC_CountryInfo_Content.8: "County Warlords"
  SIC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.8: "Although the §Rimminent rebellion§! was avoided, the Fangqu system, in reality, §Rwas a quasi-feudal arrangement§!, which reduced taxes paid to the central government. Eventually, the Fangqus §Rallowed several smaller warlord regimes to establish themselves§!, who enjoyed absolute authority in their Fangqus and the right to appoint and dismiss officials in these Fangqus at their will.\n\nHowever, the death of Sichuan was not permanent. The Empire, long divided, was on the verge of reunification. The early 1930s saw the §gSucheng Clique§! of §WLiu Xiang§! oust the §BBaoding§! educated §WLiu Wenhui§! in the §RGreat War of the Two Lius§!, declaring himself the Chairman of Sichuan. Though all warlords in Sichuan swear loyalty to the §gSucheng Clique§!, they were unable to defeat the Red Army of Xu Xiangqian, and were forced to seek help from Nanjing."
  SIC_CountryInfo_Content.9: "Republic's Loyal Sons"
  SIC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.9: "Sensing an opportunity to bring down Sichuan as he did for Guizhou, in 1935, Generalissimo §WChiang Kai-shek§! deployed §WHe Guoguang§! with the pretext of military modernisation, pushing towards centralisation step by step, culminating in the Chuankang Military Reorganisation Meeting in 1937, that was meant to deal with Sichuan once and forever.\n\nIf it came to pass, Chinese history could have been well different. If Sichuan isn't able to help contribute to the demise of the Empire of Japan, at least such that after the fall of Chongqing, the Sichuan province under the city of Chengdu can continue its resistance. The congress convened on the 6th July 1937, and §Rwhat happened on the next shook the entirety of China to the core§!, and the meeting abruptly ended on the 9th. The Sichuan army was kept autonomous, and they §Ymarched out of the basin en masse§!, providing millions after millions against the Japan."

Immediately after the §BXinhai Revolution§!, the Yuan Shikai Government noticed the growing tension in frontier provinces, and sought to specialise the governmental bodies to prevent possible secession from the Republic. Thus, the §YChuanbian Special Region§! was born, consisting of the §YChamdo Region§! in eastern Tibet and §YWestern Sichuan§!. Although the Sichuan Province still possesses administrative jurisdiction over Chuanbian, the concept of Xikang first emerged in Chinese and Tibetan history.\n\nIn 1927, §WLiu Wenhui§!, then still a prominent warlord of Sichuan seized Ya'an and expelled §WLiu Chengxun§! as the leader of Xikang. Although previously Chamdo and parts of Kangding was §Rlost to the Tibetan forces between 1914 and 1917§!, the 24th army crushed armies of the Kashag alongside §WMa Bufang§! of §BQinghai§! in a §Gstring of successful campaigns in 1930§!, securing his western domain from the Lhasa regime."

The §RGreat War of the Two Lius§! in 1936 saw his relative §WLiu Xiang§! completely expelling him from Sichuan. §RFacing a fractured society and tight budget§!, §WLiu Wenhui§! was forced to stop his tyrannical rule and harsh taxing policies. Instead, his focus shifts onto developing Xikang, finally winning the area provincial status by 1939, with himself as the chairman.\n\nDue to the Generalissimo's support of §WLiu Xiang§!, the 24th refused to actively take part in the §RSecond Sino-Japanese War§!. On the one hand, he'd find excuses to act against the central government, but on the other, he utilised resources that wouldn't have been available had he joined the war to develop a '§GNew Xikang under the Three Principles§!'. §WLiu Wenhui§! intends to build a balanced economy from the desolate lands of Xikang to achieve economic self-sufficiency."
