 POLITICS_PYOTR_MASHEROV_DESC: "Born in 1919, right after the end of the First World war, Pyotr Mirinovich Masherov was born to a simple family, living hand-to-mouth for most of his early youth. Graduating as a physics and mathematics teacher in 1939, he did not have much time to practice his profession before the Second World War broke out.\n\nAfter escaping captivity in 1941, he began forming the Komsonol underground, which would eventually become the Belarusian resistance against Nazi occupation. Mathematics teacher by day, partisan leader at night; his movement would come to be feared by Wehrmacht soldiers stationed across the country.\n\nHe would continue agitating even after the war, being one of only a few partisan groups in the area, though he would eventually lay low after the West Russian War.  And when all hope seemed lost, he heard tales of a storm brewing in Russia.\n\nHe traded his books for rifles once again, and marched into battle once more. Being of key importance to the Russian army in regards to intel, as well as supporting them by cutting off German supply and assisting in vital sieges - Masherov would come to be respected and liked by the Russian regiments that fought alongside him. After the war, he assisted the transitional government in reconstructing the region, being a valuable asset because of his popularity.\n\nIt should then be no surprise that when the voting ballots were cast, his party won with flying colors.\n\nOne day, Belarus shall be truly free, and it shall be because of his reforms."
