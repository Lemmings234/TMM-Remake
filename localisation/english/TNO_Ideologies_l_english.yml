As decried as it is praised, it can safely be said to have been, along with National Socialism, one of the defining ideologies of the 20th century so far. But what exactly is communism?\n\nDescended from the thought of Marx and Engels, and claiming the heritage of Lenin's revolution, its end goal is to establish a classless, stateless, humane society based on common ownership of the means of production and free distribution thereof according to one's needs. Its adherents are firm believers in the concept of class struggle, and aim to overthrow the bourgeoisie to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat - a society and government where the working class and the state are synonymous.\n\nWhile some movements believe in electoralism, most strains of communism are fiercely revolutionary, and tirelessly advocate for the coming of said revolution through 'praxis', or direct action. In this regard, they consciously emulate Lenin and reject the prospect of reform or compromise. Of course, critics abound from all sides; from people claiming that human nature is inherently individualistic and selfish, to socialists decrying the means employed to bring about the proletarian dictatorship, communism has no shortage of detractors. And yet, 'Reds' of all stripes fight on, for they know that once the workers of the world unite, they have nothing to lose but their chains."

Whether revolutionary or reformist, and whether marxist or utopian, it is and always has been of many different shapes. One thing remains, however: it is an ideology by the people, for the people.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of socialism is, of course, the social ownership of the means of production. While it may either be introduced gradually over time or more immediately in the case of a revolution, it is one of its stated goals, as adherents of the ideology believe that it is a way to create a juster, fairer economy, built for the many instead of for the few. Also important to socialism is the establishment of workplace democracy, giving the worker a say in how his business operates, and it is often coupled with a greater-than-usual emphasis on political democracy, whether it be electoral or soviet.\n\nSocialism has been, through the ages, equally praised as it has been reviled. And yet, it marches on. Despite the hardships, and despite the setbacks, socialism continues its almost unrelenting course, aiming to free the worker and the common man from the tyranny of capitalism."
progressivism_subtype_desc: "                                        §YPROGRESSIVISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_progressivism_bar\n\n\n\n\nA moderate response to the excesses of capitalism, Progressivism, composed of moderate social democrats and center left progressives, intends to be a middle ground between social liberalism and social democracy, with a focus on economic efficiency, a moderate welfare state, and a major focus on social justice. Pragmatic and willing to compromise, Progressivism believes in gradual change over time, with a focus on making capitalism more humane while allowing for its best aspects to shrine through.\n\nProgressivism believes in allowing room for the free market to take over while maintaining a welfare state intended to catch those who would fall through the cracks. Rather than focusing on economic equality, Progressivism intends to fight against institutional problems that harm equality of opportunity. Racism, sexism and other 'isms' are the main enemy of Progressivism, who believe that it is the government's place to protect the weak.\n\nEconomically, Progressivism believes that government management is inefficient and that, rather, the private market, with public oversight, could be beneficial to both parties. This extends to matters of infrastructure, healthcare, and even basic government operations. With this efficiency, poverty can be eliminated through saved welfare spending and opportunities for a better life."

While the cause of liberalism suffered a near-fatal blow in its defeat in the Second World War, with the former great liberal democracies of France and Britain having fallen to the Nazi jackboot, it lives on in the liberal democracies of the Western Hemisphere, and even if they, or the whole world itself even, crushed, it will never be stamped out of the human consciousness.\n\nSo long as a single human being possesses a will that is their own, the torch of liberalism shall never be extinguished."
liberal_conservatism_subtype_desc: "                                 §YLIBERAL CONSERVATISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_liberal_conservatism_bar\n\n\n\n\nIn a world filled to the brim with radicals, extremists, and vagabonds, the rational man is perhaps humanity's greatest hope. It takes discipline and a strong will to maintain the values of democracy, that brilliant idea forged on the hills of Athens, and the Liberal Conservatives are those holding the thin line that is keeping the torch of liberty lit.\n\nUnlike pure conservatives, these people are more open to social change in their society, as long as it can be tempered and controlled by the powers that be, adapting their position as needed for governance. They generally support free market economics, although individual practitioners might differ on the matter of state intervention in the economy as a means to do good for society and limit corporate power. Whether or not these moderates will be able to survive the rest of the 20th century, with all of its absolutist violence and totalitarianism, remains up in the air."
conservatism_subtype_desc: "                                        §YCONSERVATISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_conservatism_bar\n\n\n\n\nBe it a political ideology or cultural philosophy, Conservatism, as it has been defined, orientates itself around the ideals of traditionalism and a protection dedicated to preserving and refining societal and cultural institutions according to accepted societal norms, and while it traditionally has favored the right-wing of the political theater, it is not inherently opposed to working with more liberal elements in a given forum, though these are somewhat rare. Conservatives often endorse laissez-faire free market economics as a matter of course, and generally prefer fiscal austerity over increased government spending, but this is not always strictly the case.\n\nIn light of the collapse of what once been known as the great Liberal Democracies of France and Britain to the Fascist menace in Europe, Conservatism has seen a resurgence in the parts of the world hitherto untouched by Fascism, casting itself as the last line of defense for democracy against an increasingly totalitarian world.\n\nWhile many conservative-leaning politicians and governments are not against reform, many often find themselves at odds with their more liberal and progressive contemporaries in the public arena."
paternalism_subtype_desc: "                                          §YPATERNALISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_paternalism_bar\n\n\n\n\nThe political philosophy broadly falling under the denomination of Paternalism has existed as the principal ethic for myriad forms of governments throughout millennia, from Despots, to Monarchs, to Emperors. The ideology behind paternalistic forms of government paints the nascent rise in liberal political thought as a cause for injustices and instability against age-old cultural and political norms, institutions, and truths, and seeks to counter said influence through the restriction of rights and liberties, either temporarily or perhaps even permanently, as a means of preserving the nation, its society and culture for a bright and better future, likening the role of the State towards the welfare of its citizens as like the guidance from a parent to their children.\n\nThe ideological similarities to the numerous autocratic regimes currently dominating Europe and Asia in this regard are hard to ignore; both liberal and conservative forms of democracy generally abhor the dictatorialism perceived in Paternalistic forms of government, believing it to be little else but an embryonic form of emerging Fascist political thought, or a thinly veiled imitation of it. That said, few within Paternalistic societies are likely to care for the opinions of their neighbors, and will often pose stiff resistance, politically or militarily, to any attempt, internal or external, to supersede that."
despotism_subtype_desc: "                                            §YDESPOTISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_despotism_bar\n\n\n\n\nDespotism is a wide-reaching term that encompasses governmental systems where power is concentrated on a single individual or group of individuals. These people run the nation according to their own will, and almost always make heavy use of the military and the police to keep their citizens from revolting. Despotist governments very rarely tolerate other ideologies and when they do they have systems in place to prevent those groups from ever gaining power. Opposition forces are treated as enemies of the state and heavily repressed, and if elections are ever held they are either completely rigged lies or for positions with no power.\n\nDespotist governments also usually wish to establish control or dominance over other nations, and maintain extensive militaries to use in conquest and to protect the regime. While Despotists can use nationalism as a reason for their authority, they are not as nationalistic as Fascists and National Socialists and nationalism is usually more of an excuse than any real part of the agenda."
fascism_subtype_desc: "                                               §YFASCISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_fascism_bar\n\n\n\n\nOf the ideologies that emerged in the tumult following the First World War, the one that proved to have the greatest success in achieving and maintaining power in Europe was the ideology known as fascism. Borne out of the beliefs of disillusioned communists and authoritarian nationalists, fascism is often characterized as being "third positionist" due to its ideological inspiration from both the radical left and right. Although traces of Marxist doctrine can still be found buried in its worldview - it embraces a producer-parasite dialectic, but between nations instead of economic classes - its virulent nationalism puts it at odds with the internationalist mindset of socialism, and it inevitably led to violent conflict within Germany, Spain, and Italy in the interbellum decades. In all cases, the fascist parties eventually won out and forced their socialist rivals underground.\n\nFascism's most defining qualities come from its slavish devotion to the state. The government, often under the control of a single strongman, serves as the final arbitrator and authority in the land. Religious institutions, trade unions, private businesses, and the like are permitted to exist in some limited form, though their subservience to the state's authority is made clear. The government also upholds a national mythos, spinning tales of a noble people with past glories that were unfairly stripped from them, and demands that the populace find strength in unity and reclaim what was lost. They sneer at liberal nations for decadent complacency and socialist nations for succumbing to degeneracy - yet paradoxically view those outsiders as a looming threat who are posed to destroy everything they hold dear."
national_socialism_subtype_desc: "                                  §YNATIONAL SOCIALISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_national_socialism_bar\n\n\n\n\nNational Socialism, the iron fist clutching the heart of Europe for nearly thirty years, refers to the various styles of fascism which incorporate fervent racism, extreme militarism, and a totalitarian, one-party state where individuals are subordinated for the common good. It is distinct from other forms of fascism in its core tenets of brutally enforced racial hierarchy and aggressive, genocidal expansionism as "living space" for its nation's peoples.\n\nIn the German sense, Nazism holds several key tenants close to its black heart - anti-Semitism ingrained in every political action; A deep disdain for traditional liberal democracies, the parliamentary system and capitalism; and finally its strong hatred for Communism. While most National Socialist nations are either with or direct collaborators with the German Reich, the term is now often used to describe a variety of fascist movements around the world which echo Nazism's foundations, each with their own unique attributes, such as radical Japanese imperialism."
ultranationalism_subtype_desc: "                                    §YULTRANATIONALISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_ultranationalism_bar\n\n\n\n\nUltranationalism is a vicious blend of rabid militarism and fervent devotion to the nation above all else. Ultranationalists are keen to purge their nations of perceived foreign influence of any sort. Thus they favour autarky, stratification and a strong military involvement in everyday affairs to insure that the country is kept independent and "safe from outside corruption". The idea of a glorious state is the key to all things for the ultranationalist, and they will call upon images from the past to stir up and inspire in combination with a paranoid and savage hatred of the other and the outsider. Racism and other forms of discrimination are weaved into all parts of life, to further raise up and separate the ideal countryman from those that do not fit in. In order to make truth of their promises of the "great nation", ultramilitarism presents the military as the ultimate tool for prosperity and greatness. Service to the state in this manner is therefore mandatory for most and deeply glorified as a part of the nation's triumph over the rest of the world. Ultranationalism has often manifested as part of a desire for revenge against foreign enemies and uses this desire to drive the nation forward. While some differences are known to exist between each ultranationalist movement, they never differ in their mad desperation to see eternal glory rain down upon their lands."

This ideology presupposes that history progresses through a series of developmental stages leading towards communism. In the 'proletarian dictatorship' stage of society - the furthest progress attained so far - the proletariat holds absolute political power, which is exercised through their 'vanguard party'. The Party exercises complete control over all social, political, and economic life in this polity as it guides the proletariat towards a socialist, and eventually communist, society.\n\nChairman Bukharin's original contributions to the Marxist canon include the doctrine of 'Socialism In One Country': the idea that communist states should focus primarily on strengthening themselves and building their own socialist infrastructure as opposed to launching armed revolutions around the world. Simultaneously, he taught that socialism can only truly be developed over a long period of time, and that market economies should provide incentives to build up the nation's productive forces to prepare for a transition to true socialism. This was most clearly embodied in his liberal expansion of the New Economic Policy, to the point of allowing kulak farmers to enlarge the size of their farms and sell agricultural products on the open market, despite the protests of many hardline Bolsheviks. Though Bukharin is most widely known as the man who failed to save the Soviet Union from the Hun, his economic and political theories are still generally accepted as the most orthodox form of communism among its remaining adherents."
communist_stalinism_subtype_desc: "                                             §YSTALINISM§!\n\n£GFX_ideology_communist_stalinism_bar\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Vissarionovich Stalin was one of many contenders to succeed Lenin as leader of the Soviet Union. While agreeing with Bukharin on the principle of "Socialism in One Country", he rejected the market-driven development of the New Economic Policy. Instead, he believed that the State should exercise total control over the economy to spur on rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. Private enterprise could never be trusted to develop a fully socialist state, and therefore all industry and agriculture ought to be collectivized and directed by Communist Party central planners to achieve the Union's goals. A key corollary to this policy is that, far from withering away after the revolution as the old Leninists believed, the State must indeed be strengthened a thousandfold in order to implement a full transition to a communist society. This was heresy to the likes of Bukharin, who would triumph over Stalin in the succession struggle after the latter perished in a tragic industrial accident.\n\nOnce thought vanquished, Stalin's ideas have been reborn in the West Siberian People's Republic. Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism has found its Apostle in Chairman Lazar Kaganovich, a formerly obscure Soviet official banished to the Urals by Bukharin before the war. He proclaims that Stalinist collectivized industrial development would have allowed Russia to outcompete German industry and push the Hun all the way back to Berlin.

This isn't of course to say that they are entirely bound to doctrines as described in the writings of Marx and Engels, but they do seek to remain as close to its spirit as possible, even at the expense of effectiveness in the moment.\n\nA rejection of parliamentary politics entirely, a defiance of vanguard party organization and its democratic pretenses, and a firm belief in the revolution as a historical inevitability characterize the Left Communism movement. This adherence to anti-populist attitudes and a focus on theory over praxis inspires no small degree of ridicule from their fellow leftists, but given how well history has treated them so far, Left Communists rarely feel threatened by these "opportunists" as they are often called.\n\nDespite stereotypes and criticisms to that effect, Left Communists are not simply idle or lazy, awaiting for an "organic" revolution that will never come. But rather, their preparation involves planning rather than giving grand speeches, learning and studying rather than waving guns and standing on soapboxes. If knowing is half the battle, then the Left Communists have already won. It is, after all, simply a matter of time."

Despite loathing of conventional armies being common in the far-left, that sentiment typically dies out once a military apparatus is secured, and nothing has ever barred military men from adhering to that side of politics to begin with. Some men of that sort even indulge in the time-honored tradition of 'theorizing' - and where the ethos of their chosen profession meets Marxist theory, it fuses to create a new mode of thought that few other radical leftists endorse, for reasons which become quite apparent once its tenets are elaborated upon.\n\nForemost of those tenets is stated clearly in its name: the establishment of a revolutionary socialist government composed entirely of military officers and personnel. Detractors call this a cynical power-grab to hijack the revolution, little more than a revisionist junta. Those detractors (prior to their summary execution) would be met by the argument that the armed forces, being assembled from the conscripted proletariat, are the vanguard of the revolution by necessity. Moreover, the regime asserts that perpetual supremacy of the military is paramount to the ultimate triumph of socialism, for if the bourgeoisie cannot be defeated from within, it is the armed workers of the nation who must liberate their oppressed comrades by force.\n\nCries of "Revisionist!" aside, a regime of this type is still ideologically-driven and cannot simply be described as 'apolitical' or a 'junta'. It is committed to communist principles, chief among them absolute control of state, society, and economy by the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. Still, even by the standards of a revolutionary government, Stratocratic Communism is extremely hardline, tolerating no dissent and displaying shameless aggression. Civilian leadership has no place here; only the Revolutionary Army, composed of class-conscious worker-soldiers, can ensure the propagation of the world revolution and the destruction of bourgeois imperialism."

Named and inspired by the Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, it is based on his writings and posits him to be the next great Marxist theoretician, following in the footsteps of such figures as Marx, Engels, Lenin and Bukharin.\n\nIt relies on a doctrine of internationalism and anti-imperialism, but differs from traditional Bolshevism by placing an emphasis on the rural populace instead of the urban proletariat. In its fight against capitalist domination in countries where ruralism is still prevalent, it deems guerilla warfare as the best way to conduct the revolutionary struggle, under the form of a "protracted people's war".\n\nMaoism is seen by its supporters as the natural continuation of Marxist thought, and thus as the next stage of Bolshevism: its fundamentally anti-imperialist principles have seen it adopted around the world, as oppressed peoples of all stripes begin take up arm against their oppressors. This new, revolutionary deviation of traditional Marxist thought has begun to make its mark throughout world history."

Calling for revolutionary land reform and for the establishment of a system of New Democracy, adapted to China's conditions, it also advocates for the conducting of a protracted people's war, a type of guerilla warfare which it deems to be the best way to carry out the revolutionary struggle.\n\nIt is important to note that Mao Zedong Thought can be found quasi-exclusively in Asia and China proper, due to its very specific nature as an ideology: while Mao himself has influenced multiple communist movements around the globe, and is the inspiration for the aptly-named Maoism, Mao Zedong Thought can only be found in East Asia due how integral Mao's contributions to the Chinese Communist Party are."

The responsibility to donate a part of one's income to society's less fortunate, it ensures that even the poorest of the poor can live a decent life. After the beginning of the 20th century, such an altruistic worldview was remarked by some thinkers to be quite close to the ideals of socialism, and one thing led to another as Islamic socialism began to take inspiration from Marx's theses to become Islamic Marxism.\n\nTheorized by such thinkers as Ali Shariati, it applies the economical and political systems of marxism into the framework of the Sharia, and tries to enact economic and social equality for all under the guidance of an Islamic state. This means that, unlike more "traditional" socialist ideologies such as Bolshevism, the goals of Islamic Marxism are twofold: materialistic, of course, but also religious.\n\nMostly popular in countries with a majority Muslim population, Islamic Marxism has been making waves in recent years, most notably in Asia and in the Middle East. One could have thought, given the somewhat antireligious nature of Marx's writings, that such an ideology would have already collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions; but for now it shows no signs of decline, and seems poised to live on under the guidance of Allah."

While many communist parties in the continent turn to electoralism, João Amazonas, the chief ideologue of the PCdoB, posits that communists must seek to violently overthrow the capitalist system in a drawn-out "people's war", involving rural guerilla warfare of the masses away from population centers.\n\nOfficially named "Marxism-Leninism-Amazonism", this movement has its roots in the ideological chaos established after the fall of the Soviet Union, being partially inspired by the failed Chinese revolutionary experience. Amazonism firmly rejects any association with capitalist powers, seeing it as a sign of betrayal of its anti-imperialist ideals, though the movements that follow this line should often collaborate with other revolutionary groups to topple the forces of imperialism. However, Amazonism is usually regarded with distrust by other factions, especially for its disposition towards economic autarky and isolationism in foreign policy.\n\nAmazonas claims that only the vanguard party can awaken the masses and raise their consciousness towards revolutionary zeal, rejecting the Guevarist line of decentralized insurgency. While Amazonist groups focus on building rural guerrillas, they do not shy away from integrating themselves into the general labor movements and union structure, sometimes being at the head of many unions' bureaucracy. This bureaucratic aspect may represent a contradiction to Amazonas' fiercest zealots, but this dualism is integral in their fight against right-wing tyranny."

The Middle East is an area of the world that has suffered under the heel of European imperialist capitalism in very direct ways starting in the early 20th century, beginning with the carving up of the Ottoman Empire by the victorious Entente after the First World War, and then being upheaved once again by the fascistic Axis after the Second. The attraction to communism in particular is informed by this recent history, and for many, communism forms the crux of resistance against imperialism itself.\n\nMuch like other regions of the world that have suffered under the thumb of empires, communism in the Middle East began to take on a life and distinction of its own as both grassroots movements and the Arabic intelligentsia put their own spin on traditionally marxist messaging and ideology specific to their region of the world.\n\nFor many Arabic Communists, the simple changing of the mode of production was not enough. Arabic Communism not only needs to contend with foreign imperialism, but also with more conservative local leadership with a nationalist bent. To this end, the urban laborers and thinkers of the Middle East often demand change to the social fabric of the Arab World itself, with a particular emphasis on popular movement and social justice alongside political and economic change. The exact degree and character of these demanded reforms varies sharply from country to country, party to party, and even ideologue to ideologue, with Arab Communism encompassing a wide variety of movements and thoughts, from socialistic nationalists who simply want independence and socialism, to some who dream of a united pan-Arab nation to better resist outside interference and imperialist ambitions."

This mantra was preached over and over again, organizations like the various Internationales grew and grew, and the left began to embrace the whole world in its mission. And it failed. Nikolai Bukharin championed the idea of "Socialism in One Country" when he led the Soviet Union, where a single socialist nation - the USSR - would focus on strengthening itself against reaction before liberating the world. And it failed.\n\nBut internationalism was never the sole destiny of communism. Another wing had followed it - National Communism, that had posed an answer to the national question - that communism was not the enemy of nationalism. That communism is true nationalism. It is the key to liberation from the twin devils of imperialism and capitalism, who seek to suck nations dry and leave them for dead. National Communists are as diverse as the different nations that host them, from Ukraine to Central Asia to Africa. Some support a loose union of communist states, others are more isolationist, yet they are all united by a common belief in national self-determination, communism, and anti-imperialism.\n\nFor the oppressed, for the enslaved, for all who suffer under the tyranny of imperialism and capitalism, National Communism is a beacon of hope in a dark, cruel world.

The original core of Workerism was a group of marxist intellectuals who engaged in a critical revision of the interpretations of Marx's thought which had been en vogue among communists since Lenin's time. The key idea of workerism is that the traditional communist idea, preaching that the working class struggles are a reaction to capitalist development, is in fact backwards: capitalist development, according to workerists, is a reaction to the struggle of the exploited workers.\n\nThe working class is thus the "negative engine" of development, and accordingly, all revolutionary strategies must come from and be driven by the working class itself, with no interference from bourgeouis collaborationist unions and certainly not from exploitative vanguard parties. Indeed, the working class should reject any alliance with "progressive" or "empathetic" bourgeoisie. The working class must stand on its own, rely upon itself to seize power, with an emphasis on revolutionary violence and grassroots organization in order to achieve such ends. This dynamic, fresh-faced take on communist ideology has a great deal of pull among younger students and workers, for whom the fires of political and ideological enthusiasm have yet to dim."

One fateful evening, he came across a strange crystal that granted him a vision of a society founded on one, central principle:\n\n§CFriendship is Magic.§!\n\nHarmonic Communism is an idealistic ideology that blends elements of Bukharinism with the idea that friendship is the praxis by which a socialist society is achieved. Followers of Harmonic Communism believe in the §Cmagic of friendship§!, where every conflict in all levels of society is solved through mediation and not violence. The ideology strives to implement a society in which conflicts are a thing of the past, and in which everyone in the state lives happily with one another through the power of friendship.\n\nFollowers of Harmonic Communism do still believe in class conflict, but they believe that it can be overcome in ways other than a violent revolution. Through the power of friendship, they believe they can break down class barriers and allow for the dictatorship of the proletariat to naturally form from the peaceful mediation of the workers' struggle. While many may see this as hilariously unrealistic in its idealism, Nikolai Buckharin has proven his ideology to be both surprisingly successful and attractive to the weary citizens of Russia. Soon, harmony and socialism will be spread throughout all of Russia, and even, eventually, the world." #Please somebody add an id bar for this

Despite this emphasis on revolution, many among the Ba'ath still view the party's stance as simply too moderate and advocate a more radical synthesis of Ba'athism and Marxist concepts.\n\nThese aptly named "Revolutionary Ba'athists" critique Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar's works from a leftist perspective, as opposed to the rightist perspective that would traditionally level criticism and slander against the Ba'ath. In a reversal of traditional Ba'athist perspectives, the Revolutionary Ba'ath would abandon the view that socialism is a method to be utilised in fulfilment of Arab unity. They would instead adopt the position of Arab unity being a method utilised to achieve socialism, declaring an affinity between the Arab revolution and the class struggle, and rejecting the class collaboration espoused by mainstream Ba'athists.\n\nSeeing the enactment of quasi-Leninist policy to be essential to the rebirth of the Arab nation in the zealous flames of revolutionary fire, they decry the founding duo's abandonment of Marxist dialectics and instead profess a vision strongly influenced by the theories of Marx, Lenin, Bukharin and other militant revolutionaries from across the spectrum of radical leftist politics. This deviant radicalism is seen most clearly in their frequent clashes with the intellectual orthodoxy of the party over the topic of class and the very definition of socialism."

It would seem, at least on the surface, that anarchism is like a hydra- for every anarchist that is killed, imprisoned, or 'disappeared', two more will pop up in their place. But why?\n\nAnarcho-Communism is a radical left-wing ideology that is contrasted to more standard socialist ideologies like Marxism and democratic socialism by its strong opposition to authority, which it claims as synonymous with the evils of capitalism. Anarcho-communists are also notable for their distaste for large-scale industrialization, preferring to rely on local communes and farms for production. Anarcho-communists have had several brief moments of relative power, most notably with Nestor Makhno's Free Territory in Ukraine in 1920. But just as anarcho-communist societies are united behind common goals, they are also divided by almost everything else. Infighting, chaos and confusion are present in all anarcho-communist societies, and this usually leads to their downfall.\n\nModern Anarcho-Communism began with the works of thinkers like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin in the mid-1800s. Seeking the total destruction of all forms of oppression, from capitalism to racism to the state itself, anarcho-communists exist in their own political bubble- scorned by the left and hated by the right. Nonetheless, Anarcho-Communism serves as a beacon of hope for any who have been cast aside by the existing system.

This mix spiritualism and materialism may seem like an oxymoron at first glance, but that has not stopped thinkers and theologians from synthesizing the two. They consider themselves to be just as devout as any other Christian, and they reject Marxist beliefs that religion is an "opiate of the masses" that is ultimately incompatible with the goal of revolution.\n\nAlthough many argue that socialism is inherently hostile to Christianity, Christian socialists argue that it is actually capitalism that is incompatible: they consider it to be akin to idolatry, a cult of the Almighty Dollar that encourages greed and condemns charity. They turn to the Bible to both support their viewpoints, pointing out that Jesus said "One cannot serve both God and wealth," as well as how the earliest Christians "held everything in common" and collectively shared their possessions. Only collectivist social policies, they say, can stay close to Christ's teachings while also helping all those in society."

In practice, this means such varying ideologies as Democratic Socialists, who believe in revolution through the ballot box, and authoritarian socialists, who are disgusted with what they describe as 'bourgeois democracy', are expected to cooperate and work together for the advancement of socialism.\n\nThis, unsurprisingly, can lead to a very incoherent bloc, with actual governing policies being based upon internal compromise or the result of certain factions winning out against others. Typically, the Revolutionary Front is most often seen in places where the political left can only hope to maintain power through a big tent and coalition building, or in places that are under threat from the right wing that seek to undermine the ability for such left parties to exist in the first place.\n\nRevolutionary Front leaders are as diverse as their base, and are often instrumental in maintaining the survival of the Front in the first place, if not its actual creator.

Along with a socialistic economic system, and the collective ownership of the means of production, agrarian socialism aims to realise an agrarian utopia, where the farmer toils away happily, for he knows that he truly and finally gets to reap the ripe fruits of his labor.\n\nImportant to note, however, is that Agrarian Socialism is not an inherently revolutionary ideology: indeed, it can come to power through the ballot box as well as through the barrel of a gun, which makes it a quite broad and adaptable ideology to its supporters. Of course, it is not without its detractors: claims from the left that socialism and true equality cannot be achieved without industrialisation coincide with more "traditional" critiques from the right, which argue against the merits of socialism altogether."

In short, it is the workers' ownership of the means of production, whether directly or through the state. What, then, is more purely socialistic than Syndicalism - the idea that workers wrest from the capitalist class control of society and the economy through the revolutionary action of the general strike, and build a new society on the basis of trade unions directly composed of the workers themselves, with no middleman?\n\nSyndicalism argues for direct action - strikes, sabotage of production, and demonstrations - against the capitalist system both to secure better conditions for workers while living under capitalism and to ultimately overthrow and replace it altogether. Though the successes of the October Revolution and other factors sent the syndicalist movement into decline and marginalization, it has never truly gone away; perhaps one day, a new generation of syndicalists will strike fear into the hearts of bourgeoisie and politicians alike as the militants and saboteurs of the early 1900s did."

Originally pioneered in the early 18th and 19th century, Utopian socialism is primarily based upon both a distinct dislike of class conflict and a belief in the perfectibility of mankind and of society in general. Whether it be through the creation of local communes, making industry more efficient through nationalization of certain goods and services, or just simply a moral belief in raising the entire society as a whole through government and local intervention, utopian socialists believe that mankind as a whole can be brought up to a higher standard of living than what capitalism can currently deliver to us.\n\nThe biggest distinction between utopian socialists and their Marxist cousins is a distinct dislike of class conflict or revolution, believing instead that all classes would be willing to adhere to such a system through convincing. This places it in opposition to the materialistic worldview that Marxism and more pragmatic socialists who intend on creating working class coalitions to win power. While most utopian experiments have failed, many persist in their experiments, believing that, one day, a perfect system of humanity can be created, and that all of mankind can bask in its glory of a newer, better world."

Its proponents reject the idea of individual African nations, socialist or otherwise- instead preaching that, in order to truly stand against European colonizers, Africa must stand united under one banner. Falling on the far-left of the political spectrum, Pan-Africanism can be easily differed from its counterpart in African Socialism by its vanguardist attitude, its emphasis on anti-imperialism, and its staunch adherence to a pan-national identity for what Europe once called the "Dark Continent".\n\nWhile its adherents are primarily found in West Africa- specifically Cameroon- and South Africa as a major part of the ANC, ideologues can be found from Cape Town to Cairo- even gaining traction among Black communities in the United States and the Caribbean.

Ba'athist ideology combines notions of pan-Arabism, Arab socialism, and secularism into an ideological platform that aims to mobilize and subsequently unify the whole Arab nation through revolutionary struggle, regardless of faith or region.\n\nThe Ba'ath party functions as the universal vanguard for the Arab nation, accelerating its development in order to bring about the renaissance into all aspects of life. Its ostensible goals are progress, liberty, and socialism as defined by Aflaq, within a context suited to the Arab world. Dedication to modernization and progress means that the party opposes not only foreign rule but also all the forms of feudal and noble reaction across the Arab world. Liberty in the Ba'athism sense does not necessarily mean liberal parliamentary democracy, as it may subvert the revolution, and socialism here substitutes the Marxist notion of class struggle for a national struggle against colonialism. 'Arab Socialism' is considered an important means of reaching the renaissance, but not its ultimate purpose.\n\nIn reality, the ideological purity of Ba'athist parties across the Middle East is incredibly varied and intrinsically linked with local culture and tradition, as well as an influx of foreign political theories. The policies followed by the Ba'athist movements range from the rampant militarism of some branches to promises of representative democracy and socialism by others. Their only common goal is the creation of a united Arab state, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf."

The proponents of left-wing nationalism transform socialist agitation into a weapon with which to combat either imperialist interference and influence in society.\n\nIn the Cold War, left-wing nationalism is a wide label: it describes both revolutionary tendencies and electoralist reform; it covers a broad range of adherents, from Europe to Asia, from Africa to America. Despite this wide-ranging appellation, however, they all have something in common: nationalism is not irreconcilable with socialism or socialistic policies, and that self-determination and political independence is a necessary step in achieving equality and liberty."

His ideas have come to be known as Guevarism.\n\nIn its current context, Guevarism is an umbrella term for a variety of leftist movements whose chief distinction is their organization around the Revolutionary Coordination Junta and Guevara as a rallying figurehead. Radically breaking from all mainstream communist thought, Guevarism outright rejects the need for any established vanguard party to organize a Marxist revolution. Instead, small fast-moving bands of insurgents act as the vanguard themselves, mimicking Che's own experiences in the Cuban Revolution. Through generating discontent among the peasant class, propagandizing, and guerrilla warfare, the insurgents will put enough pressure on any corrupt and oligarchic political system to stir the populace into armed rebellion.\n\nIts fundamentally unifying tenets are an inherent focus on the peasantry and rural areas over the traditional urban workers, armed struggle, internationalism, and a belief in revolutionary willpower - that any group of sufficiently motivated militants will find success. Guevarism has mostly found success in Latin America as the mainstream strand of leftist revolutionary thought, but it lacks a formal doctrine due to its internationalist nature, and in consequence, the many differences in thought within the organizations tied to the Junta."

Like any ideology defined by the dictates of its founder, it is characterized by a certain level of flexibility and a lack of rigidness. However, in spite of this, Nasserism is characterized by three core principles.\n\nFirst is its Pan-Arabism, advocating for a union of Arab republics to secure itself across the Middle East to better protect against incursions from imperialist powers. Nasserism's flavor of Pan-Arabism is also characterized by its secular nature, often putting it into conflict with other grassroot ideologies in the region that are more colored by religious thought, whether it be Islamic, Christian or Jewish. Even if an Arab nation could not be formed, Nasser looks to aid and support the Arab world with only some regard to their own ideology, so as to protect the region as a whole.\n\nThe second is of course, its simultaneous embrace of socialism and rejection of communism. While self-described communists and their parties are suppressed as it is seen as being at odds with Arab tradition, they wholeheartedly embrace a fluid interpretation of Arab Socialism, most obviously manifesting in a generally anti-capitalist stance and the aggressive nationalization of Egypt's resources.\n\nThe third is Anti-Imperialism. One could even argue that the first two principles are merely a function of this third principle, when you get right down to it. Nasser's strong anti-imperialist stances are the core motivation for involvement outside of Egypt itself, as well as the populist rallying cry that lends the ideology most of its fervent support.\n\nBeyond these broad points, Nasserism is an ideology that has in of itself a great deal of leeway without an orthodoxy to limit its possible allegiances and shifts as the situation demands, whether for Egypt's sake, or Nasser's own."

There are, however, various commonalities that unite them, and that is a belief in peaceful revolution through the ballot box, an explicit opposition to the human rights abuses that other communist regimes have committed, and a recognition that all communist parties have to deal with different circumstances in different countries, as against the Bukharin 'one size fits all' approach.\n\nLoyally committed to democracy and the pluralistic rights that come from such traditionally western institutions, Neocommunism criticizes the collapsed Soviet Union under Bukharin as materially incapable of truly satisfying the conditions through which communism could be established, in addition to having its vanguardist ideology undermine the will of the working class. In contrast, Neocommunism seeks to maintain its interests as a vehicle of working class consciousness and power.

Unlike syndicalists, however, radical unionists believe in establishing a federal republican structure for the socialist, co-operative commonwealth. \n\nIn order to achieve this goal, they organize simultaneously on the shop floor and in the electoral arena, working both in the productive sphere through militant unions and in the political realm through a socialist political party. The union and the party form two equal wings of the same movement, each helping support the other. Inspired by the work of theorists and militants like Eugene Debs, Daniel De Leon, and James Connolly, they reject both the violent coups and vanguardism of mainstream Marxism and Leninism, and the pure reformism of modern social democracy. Instead, radical unionists believe in building a mass movement that provides a party with a mandate to take office and turn political power over to the industrial unions. Instead of seizing power through an anarchist general strike, the transfer of control of the factories, mines, farms and other means of production to workers’ councils organized within the industrial unions would be achieved by victory at the polls followed by constitutional action."

African Socialism is an ideology formed as a result of the sudden independence achieved by many former French and British colonies in the wake of the Second World War. Instead of following their former colonizers in pursuing a capitalist model, African Socialists sought out an ideology that was more afrocentric.\n\nThe main distinction between African Socialism and more classical strains of socialism is the focus on the sharing of economic resources in a traditional African way. Some African Socialists believe that Africa's background in tribal community life excludes the validity of the theory of class struggle, and makes socialism the natural way of life for African nations.\n\nWhile pan-Africanist, this form of African Socialism does not conform to the ideology adhered to by Cameroon. This form of African Socialism is much more grassroots and decentralized. Seeking a more moderate path, this strain of African Socialism seeks to respect local African traditions and structures. It is also not focused on expansionism, unlike the Cameroonian brand, although it is not necessarily opposed to violence."

The Front is usually forged first by finding some bare minimum ground, often of the moral variety, upon which to oppose the nascent threat. In other instances, a common matter of policy or ideology provides the adhesive element that keeps the Popular Front united, if the Front itself might lean more socialist or more liberal in its composition. And then its strategy is solidified, whether it is an agreement to vote in accordance with one another, or to support one another in terms of direct action and conflicts in the streets.\n\nThe sheer variety of applications of the Popular Front, as it should be clear, makes it hard to define precisely. As such, it may not be considered much of an ideology at all, so much as a strategy that parties and groups of parties pursue to advance their ideologies."

While mainstream Radicalism will reject all socialists and socialist philosophy wholesale as a matter of principle, it is the Social Radical who finds common ground with them, reaching for their mutual goals and putting aside historical rivalries to do so.\n\nAbove all else, the Social Radical aims for the establishment of equality, an end to want, and the elevation of social programs to aid in the former two ambitions. They are willing to make whatever compromises are necessary to end inequality in whatever forms it takes. Many further to their right call them idealistic, naive even, and those further to their left call them unimaginative, lacking in ambition or true dedication to the cause they profess.\n\nDespite this disdain they receive from both ends of the political spectrum, Social Radicalism continues to plow its own road ahead, to finish the work that the Enlightenment had started."

It differs from most other forms of Christian Democracy by virtue of a greater impetus for social change, as opposed to a call for conservatism, though it still maintains the belief that Democracy is the best means of achieving Christian values. Oftentimes, it seeks to interpret Christianity through the lens of modern knowledge, science and ethics, as opposed to those held at the time of the writing of the scriptures. In terms of economic policy, Christian Progressivism is usually in the center, though it can lean further to the left or to the right depending on the specific application. Socially, Christian Progressivism is usually center-left, being especially likely to be so on issues such as Civil Rights. However, Christian Progressives can often lean conservative on certain issues due to the fact that the ideology is still heavily based on Christian thought. Christian Progressivism also tends to place more weight on Christian values and morality, as opposed to adherence to specific Christian doctrine."

Born from the minds of men like Alexander Herzen and Pyotr Lavrov, this new strain of Agrarianist thought is primarily oriented around typical agrarian goals: prioritization of farming in the national framework, the promotion of the farmer in the ideals of the state, and an attempt at egalitarianism; though Left-Wing Agrarianism comes with its own set of rules.\n\nConflicting with the typical Bukharinist-Marxist divide, Left-Wing Agrarianism heavily prioritizes the rural farmer in the everyday life and function of the state, and sees them as a class in of themselves, no matter how many times the unique strain of Socialism finds itself being called ideological heathens in doing so."

The only way forwards for a Muslim Ummah free of colonial chains is under a harmonic society that equally dignifies all of its subjects regardless of their sex, faith, race or class."

This is wrong—a liberal socialist, unlike a progressive, will self-identify as a socialist, and has at least a theoretical aim the construction of a socialist system.\n\nPrimary doctrines of liberal socialism include leveraging the market to further socialist goals, emphasizing welfare systems built via the construction of quality public services, and the expansion of public-private partnerships as an alternative to nationalizations. The liberal socialist ideology developed as the middle class grew in many nations through the 60s and 70s, and lost interest in outright socialism without becoming opposed to left-wing governance.\n\nThough liberal socialism insists that it remains socialist, this can be brought into question at times, especially when the policies of a nominally liberal socialist party seem similar to those of a liberal party. If this is the case, it is entirely possible that more orthodox socialist factions may reduce support or outright oppose a governing liberal socialist party, which in turn can cause massive rifts within the left wing of a multiparty democracy."

With his deep roots in the Democratic Party and brain trust of established experts, he built an array of programs that formed the foundation of the modern welfare state. But Franklin is not the only figure of inspiration. For some, the Roosevelt of Hyde Park was too establishment, too traditional. Some find their inspiration elsewhere—in the rolicking and unpredictable example of his distant relative Teddy who worked his way up through the corrupt New York system determined to change it.\n\nEastern Progressives are inspired by this example. Familiar with established systems and convinced of the need for radical change, Eastern Progressivism is the ideology of reformers and public advocates. It is a movement dominated by large, old-money figures who—out of a sense of duty or for their political survival—have arrayed themselves against the institutions built by their ancestors long ago. They see an urgent need to advance science, economic development, and liberal political thought for the betterment of all people across society.\n\nWhile Eastern Progressives have much in common with their Western counterparts, there are several notable differences. First, Eastern Progressives are inspired more by large, established, and orderly cities like New York and Boston than by the openness of the American frontier. They are less gun-toting than their Western counterparts and built around established power centers. Second, this very familiarity with established power centers often makes them less willing to destroy them outright. Rather than burn the system down, Eastern Progressives are often more focused on renovating those systems and expanding them to include new groups and peoples."

The great rivers and prairies of the west were a land of opportunity where any man, regardless of birth, could make his way forwards with nothing but grit and determination. And now, the American West is the epicenter of the latest attempt to make the United States truly live up to its creed of liberty and justice for all: Western Progressivism. \n\nWhile the Progressivism of the East Coast has long since turned to compromising with the traditional institutions and power brokers of the United States in the name of change, Western Progressives turn up their noses at this pragmatism. They see all the traditional institutions of political power, from corporations to machine politics to career politicians themselves, as nothing more than tools for the powerful to keep the common man down. Western Progressives have a reputation as being a more authentic representation of the will of those they represent than the politicians of DC, immersed as they are in backroom politics. But with this authenticity can come a lack of unity and purpose, and a refusal to compromise even when doing so is necessary to political success. \n\nNow, Western Progressivism has found its home with the Progressive caucus of the NPP, seeking to lead a new American Revolution to sweep aside the legacy of racial and class inequalities forever. They have risen a wave of popular disenchantment both with the inequality of American society and the corruption of Washington to the White House. But now, they must not simply agitate, but govern. Will this new generation of American dreamers finally change the country for good, or will they become that which they swore to destroy?"

It retains liberalism's emphasis on individual and economic freedom, but stresses that the continued health of the two is predicated on continued, unthreatened national sovereignty. National Liberal theory can manifest in anti-immigration and economically protectionist policy, but also in support for limited industrial planning and state subsidies for critical economic sectors.\n\nNational Liberal praxis, however, is not tightly bound by strict ideological tenets. Because National Liberal theory orbits the salient concerns of sovereignty and liberty, subservient policy areas can be reoriented in their defense. Protectionist economic policy can sometimes give way to free trade agreements, and industrial planning to free enterprise, if doing so is considered conducive to the maintenance of state sovereignty and individual liberty."

In the 40's, Italy's and Germany's utter and complete victories over the democracies of Western Europe looked to be the deathknell of their ideology, but twenty years later, one can see that has not been the case.\n\nAfter the stagnations and failures of Italy and Germany in the 1950's, people began to look for answers once more, and a renewed faith in Enlightenment ideals has taken root in many parts of the world, especially in the West.

It is to be the standard bearer of Wilson's internationalism and support for robust institutions. It is to be the defender of the welfare state put in place by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and expanded by his successors Dwight D. Eisenhower and Estes Kefauver. The modern American liberal is the culmination of all these figures—a stalwart defender of civil rights, equality, social justice, and a regulated market economy. They look toward the future while firmly rooted in the traditions of the past.\n\nJeane Kirkpatrick's liberalism is about strength. On the domestic front, strength is about giving people the power they need to seize control of their destinies—bolstering unions, eliminating bias from the workplace, and enriching everyday families. It is also about reinforcing America's institutions by marginalizing those cynical, unpatriotic, and "able-bodied but lazy" persons who make up America's extremes. In foreign affairs, liberalism is about aggressively expanding democracy through the assertion of American military power. Kirkpatrick's liberalism would see the military and intelligence establishment unshackled in its effort to end totalitarianism everywhere. There will be no peaceful coexistence. America will assert its interests all across the globe—without apology.\n\nYet, it remains unclear whether this latest manifestation of liberalism will withstand the struggles America faces abroad and at home. There is a sense among the mainstream that this liberalism has replaced the welfare-oriented policies of previous administrations with policies of radical self-interest. The disaffected fringes, meanwhile, see Kirkpatrick as a confirmation of what they always knew about the American government's real imperialistic designs. If not carefully managed, liberalism could find itself delegitimized at home and abroad."

Recruiting on merit to the best of their ability, their aim is to take away as much power as possible from the hands of elected officials and party cadres. This may seem undemocratic; many have raised this objection. Liberal technocrats' response to that charge is generally to point at the sclerotic, byzantine nature of the state bureaucracies they have often emerged to respond to.\n\nSo taking away power from incompetent, illiterate elected officials is undemocratic. But how democratic is permitting bureaucrats to form political mafias that bloat the State and destroy its ability to get things done? How democratic is it to permit government officials, whose job is allegedly to serve the people, to instead engage in eye-watering degrees of internal corruption and nepotism that eat away at the state's institutions and government?\n\nIf that is one's idea of liberty, so be it—but the liberal technocrat will never accept that answer. The State must serve its people, not parasitise them; technocracy is the sole guarantor of such a state."

In most circumstances, these regimes establish themselves due to a Naval Military coup, or when a Navy Seizes a territory. While this ideology is very Localized to the territory it is found in, most often Thalassocracies operate similar to military dictatorships, with a charismatic one man leader, with the key difference being that Thalassocracies are dictatorships of the Navy. Thalassocracy is not an ideology that comes with a specific form for the economy. Anything from plunder to capitalism to socialism has been witnessed on separate occasions. For these states, the Navy comes first, and everything else comes second, with much of their Control coming from the Oceans, with their Land Territories being only useful for service, repair, and supplies. Due to this “Navy-First” mentality, Thalassocracies have a tendency to neglect the territories they hold on dry land, having a government structure very similar to Ships at Sea, with the Naval chain of command being applied to civilian administration. When their Ships are clean and their Men are Merry, Thalassocracies know that they have succeeded."

Sometimes, however, Market Liberals are willing to intervene in the economy for the sake of increasing economic development, such as subsidies and tax credits.

Beyond this foundation, there is next to no set standard of what is Christian Democracy, and there are many beliefs and ideas on how to go about it.\n\nSome parties are opposed to both of the "materialist" ideologies of Capitalism and Socialism, while others support a social market economy that supports free market economics with a strong government supported safety net and regulations. Other parties claiming to be Christain Democratic can be seen as either conservative or liberal depending on the country and history. Or they can straddle the line: maybe they are center-left on economic issues and civil rights, while center-right on cultural, social and moral issues.\n\nChristian Democracy can be almost any denomination, though most are Catholic or some variation of Protestantism.

Rejecting radicalism from both sides of the political spectrum, its proponents instead attempt to appeal to the vast sea of voting blocs in America through broadly populist rhetoric, flexible reforms, and a paternalistic attitude towards the nation's citizens.\n\nOwing in large part to Nixon's own pragmatism, Silent Conservatism often hesitates in taking any strong positions on political issues, instead preferring to stick to a middle-ground that largely follows the majority opinion on any particular subject.

They believe that the role of the federal government should not be to enforce standards or manipulate the fabric of society but to be as unobtrusive as possible, visible only insofar as is necessary to guarantee individual rights and allow business to thrive.\n\nOf course, the kinds of societies that Natural Conservatives hope for vary wildly.

In short, it is an ideology that attempts to build representative democracy while abiding by all the norms. For example, the term "democracy," which loosely translates into "Popular Sovereignty" in Japanese, is a taboo since it challenges the Imperial Sovereign. "Constitution protection" is however a perfectly acceptable alternative as it avoids the issue of sovereignty altogether and instead focuses on protecting people's rights, sanctioned by the Emperor and outlined in the Imperial Constitution, from malignant actors like Meiji oligarchs or the Toseiha officers in the past.\n\nNeedless to say, as a form of conservatism, Goken Conservatism embraces many traditional values such as patriotism, traditional gender roles, and disdain for Western Democracy. At the same time, the adherents of Goken Conservatism also seek to ensure national policies reflect the popular will via electoral politics while attempting to interpret the popular will in accordance with Imperial Sovereignty. Although the narrative of Goken Conservatism makes the system particularly vulnerable to Meiji Era constitutional loopholes designed to empower the Emperor, it is nevertheless a genuine attempt to return to Japan's interrupted democratic experiments in the Taisho Era after thirty years of totalitarianism."

Prairie Populists can advocate moderate or even progressive solutions to economic and social problems, but always with an underlying moralism and esteem for tradition that is hostile to radical or revolutionary changes in the structure of society. Steadfastly supportive of democracy and of the conceptual idea of state institutions, it is only the kleptocrats and the ne'er-do-wells defiling the halls of power, and not those halls themselves, that the Prairie Populist seeks to tear down.

However, he also further divided politics into §Yrights of participation (in politics)§! and §Yrights of governance§!, as he believes democracy will function at maximum capacity if the people democratically elect professional bureaucrats in a kind of §Yrepresentative democracy§!, who then go on and represent their people and then participate in the political process.\n\nAnd as such, the political ideology is fundamentally §Yanti-decentralisation§!. Government authority is reinforced around every corner, and the population is §Rdiscouraged from directly participating§! in the legislative process. Fusing democratic centralism and separation of powers, the §YQuinquepartite regime§! is considered a modern rebirth of the traditional Confucian theory of the paternal but good nature of the government."

The state becomes an organ by which this national cohesion is strengthened, and although many national conservatives support laissez-faire economic policies; others believe that the state should provide for the people in a paternalistic capacity.

To colonize a land, a people, and a country is to deny them of their right to a proper existence. It turns the nations that fall victim to it into husks of what they could have become, and it turns its perpetrators into glutenous parasites, incapable of proper social function. This state of affairs can be seen clearly all over the world, whether it be with the Americans and Europeans in Africa or with the Japanese in Asia.\n\nNo crime can go unanswered for too long, however, and the answer to the brutality of colonialism is the theory of Social Nationalism. It, unlike the nationalism which birthed the Reich and the Showa, posits that the colonized can become nationally cohesive units through the recognition of a shared struggle. Social nationalists do not argue that their people should unite on the grounds of their ethnic or cultural superiority, instead, they must unite to defeat their oppressors. Although social nationalism can use any economic system to achieve its aims, most of its proponents also struggle for the establishment of at least some form of socialism in their lands.\n\nIn the first decade following the war, social nationalism found itself crushed under the weight of German bombs and Japanese military exercises, but the world is changing now.

The ability for the citizens of the nation to have a say in how their government is to be run and managed is one of the greatest achievements in the past few centuries. Elections provide accountability through the ballot box and allow the marketplace of ideas to weed out the bad ideas. But the largest problem with democracy is the fact that sometimes the people don't know what they want, or what is best for them. In fact it's very likely that voters, blinded by impossible promises or destructive slogans, can actually destroy the nation by elected unqualified politicians. Many a Fascist or Communist dictatorship was established in democracies with lies and vague promises, and look how that has turned out!\n\nControlled Democracy resolves this flaw by preventing such radical and destructive thoughts from entering the system with the use of heavy government propaganda to tell the people what is best for them, and ensuring that all the political parties in the nation agree with and support the long term strategies of the nation. Free and fair elections are still held, but the results will never challenge the overarching goals of the nation, no matter what that goal is.\n\nThere is opposition to Controlled Democracy, namely that elections are seen as a sham, and it's basically an authoritarian system in the disguise of a democracy.

Rather than involving a suspension of the constitution, stratocracies often have constitutions in laws explicitly supporting the military's role in society.\n\nThough stratocracies do not by nature have to be oligarchic or autocratic, they often end up as such due to the necessities of military rule. Stratocracies that do not take care to maintain their meritocratic characteristics usually become regular military dictatorships, and the civilian government and armed forces separate, not always peacefully.\n\nThis fusion of military and democratic governance is exceedingly rare, and comes about through a combination of meritocratic beliefs and sustained military pressure, such as through war or domestic conflict. This rarity should not be mistaken for weakness, however. A stratocracy is legion, and a legion conquers."

They may be separated from the general population because of their wealth, education, military or political control, or in some cases, a minority group that maintains control of the majority. This form of government can be backed up by law, either under the guise of an emergency or transitional government, or through illegal or secret means. Although some oligarchal states pass power down hereditarily, this does not ring true for every oligarchy government.\n\nAn oligarchy can arise from many different circumstances. For instance, over time power can become concentrated in the hands of the elite through continued enfranchisement of the upper class, until the wealthy dominate all aspects of government, either overtly or covertly. Or perhaps after a coup d'etat, a victorious general works to entrench the power of his clique or the military in general over the population.\n\nAlthough one oligarchy state can be vastly different from the other in terms of what group is in power, they all usually exert heavy control over the populace. Civil liberties are usually limited, and voting at any level is usually restricted. However, exceptions can be found in states where some form of sham democracy, whether a sham by intention or by effect, exists. These sham elections may allow for a veneer of democracy, but ultimately the average person has no control over their leaders."

Violently rejecting communism, it aims to provide a twentieth-century basis for dealing with present-day issues, rejecting a purely materialistic approach to socio-economic and political problems, and promoting inter-class solidarity, brotherhood, Christian tolerance, and charity. They also claim to promote democratic participation in government (with or without a Russian monarch), individualism, and civil liberties. Their end goal is to bring about a Second Revolution that is "neither left nor right but at the front" and will rebirth Russia without returning to Bolshevik or Tsarist errors.\n\nIts critics, on the other hand, argue that it displays a predisposition towards a corporatist organization of society and an overfriendliness to the prospect of a "temporary" dictatorship in order to bring about their desired "moral and spiritual regeneration".

Almost always the result of invasion or annexation, military mandates tend to be authoritarian, and preoccupied with eliminating local resistance. Military mandates can be temporary structures, designed merely to protect a strategic region, facilitate annexation, or help smoothly transition into a new regime.\n\nWith complete control of government given to a foreign military power, there tends to be little civilian representation in these regimes, and they often are dominated by that foreign government's interests and ambitions. These military mandates rarely, if ever, have any true independence. If their masters demand they endanger the stability of their regime in order to comply with orders, they will follow those orders. If their masters demand they dismantle their regime and return home, they'll do exactly that.\n\nRegardless of their support amongst the local populace, military mandates live and die by the competency of their soldiers and officers. An incompetent regime quickly becomes a massive resource drain for the occupying power, quickly becoming counterproductive to their initial purpose. However, even a powerful military can crumble if they fail to adapt to their conditions, and the demands of the people.

Against all odds, they have found common ground and developed a compatible worldview.\n\nNeoconservatism holds that the highest form of government is the liberal democracy, as embodied in nations like the United States of America. These free nations have the moral obligation to propagate democracy at every opportunity, as well as fight the influence of totalitarian fascism or communism They are heavily influenced by "containment theory," which advocates actively countering fascism or communism at every opportunity, and condemn détente as capitulation to tyranny.\n\nEconomically, neoconservatives reject standards of both traditional conservatism and liberalism. Although they are fine with deficit spending and are not rabidly opposed to "big government," they nonetheless believe in the necessity of free market capitalism, and oppose any and all barriers to free international trade.

Douglas after World War I. In the 1920s, he argued that economic depressions were caused by arbitrary discrepancies between the market prices of goods, the costs of their production and the wages of those who produced them. Essentially, he noticed that businesses were arbitrarily selling the prices of their manufactured goods far higher than their workers could actually afford. Because of this artificial scarcity created in the pursuit of profit, the workers' lives suffered and economies were hindered by lower consumer spending. To remedy this, Douglas called for governments to distribute money, or "social credit", to consumers in order to close the gap between production and their own purchasing power so that consumer spending could rise and drive economic growth.\n\nIn Canada, Douglas's economic theories have been synergized with Christian fundamentalism to form a right-wing populist political programme. The Social Credit Party worships individualism and private enterprise almost as much as they worship Christ. They call for a vast expansion of the money supply through providing direct lines of credit to consumers and producers and decry the national debt as a tool used by international bankers to loot the economy for profit. While championing free markets, they are far less keen on free moral choice. They are rabid opponents of counter-culture movements and believe their conservative interpretation of Christianity should be upheld as Canada's official religion. Some members of the party even praise the economic policies of the Iberian Caudillos and the late Duce of Italy, and progressive Canadians dread discovering where Social Credit will take their nation."

It's possible, in times like these, that the political party can travel with the tide and emerge with a near-monopoly on power, even in systems that include democratic systems and traditions.\n\nIt is not that there is a lack of other parties or ideologies, but that it has been difficult or impossible for them to gain enough in the way of traction or foundations to challenge the establishment. As a result, any meaningful pluralism of politics and ideas takes place within the party's halls itself, rather than necessarily by way of democratic discourse, a fact that only serves to make ending the system all the less likely.\n\nThis entrenchment and institutionalization of power is often aided by the very foundation and democratic structure of a country, which is shaped to favor it. But these institutional methods act as a mere safeguard, in case the primary means of maintaining control falls through.

In the course of accomplishing this, Colonel Perón's movement absorbed wildly different ideological currents: Socialists, Conservatives, Catholic Liberals, and Fascists; all congreated around the rising figure of Perón, and their views seeped into the virgin mold of the ideology of which he would become the namesake. Which particular facet of Peronism is most prominent on any given day is ultimately the Colonel's decision. Years of manoeuvring in and out of government have, however, distorted and stretched the definition virtually beyond recognition.\n\nInsofar as Peronism - or Justicialism, its technical name - still retains any recognizable characteristics beyond its vagueness, its exaltation of the unwashed masses against the decadence of oligarchy, its predilection for economic nationalism, and its adoration for trade unions, are just about all that remains.

However, when it comes to the great crusade for economic growth, which would subsequently improve the overall welfare of the citizens, Authoritarian Developmentalists believe that they are justified in suspending the "political excess" of democratic governance or freedom of expression to maximize economic output.\n\nIn short, the legitimacy of an Authoritarian Developmentalist regime hinges on the leader's ability to bring constant economic growth, instead of votes from his constituents. If the leader became unable to deliver his promise, he would usually either be forced to step down, or to attempt to cling to power by writing his people a bigger check in the future.\n\nIn most cases, the latter option poses a great risk, as the only reason why the masses are content with the regime is the money for which they "sold" their rights. If the leader resorted to promising large, non-withdrawable checks too often, he would face challenges both from within and without the government, and would most likely be better off if he had agreed to a peaceful transition of power in the first place."

Most commonly, the monarch leaves the day to day management of the state to their ministers, but any decision can be overturned or reversed by them. With a history extending back thousands of years, absolute monarchy is one of the oldest and most enduring systems of government.\n\nThe transition from antiquity to the medieval era across the world saw the control of monarchs diminished in favor of the power of the aristocracy, who in some cases had only a nominal allegiance to their king. As the feudal eras of Europe and Asia waned, however, this arrangement quickly began to change once more.\n\nAs kingdoms and empires grew in strength around the world, the powers of the nobility were increasingly wielded by the monarch and their ministers, especially in Europe. Even as the powers of European monarchs were curtailed in favor of constitutional governments, absolute monarchies continued to survive in much of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Today, in a world desperate for hope, some might seek to place all faith in royalty once again. As the great French king Louis XIV once said: "One king, one law, one faith.""

Often this involves a suspension of the constitution of the state, and the rights contained therein. This leaves juntas free to stabilize the country into accepting their rule.\n\nAn authoritarian oligarchic rule characterizes a junta, with power shared among military leaders rather than centralized in a single person. Sometimes, civilian governmental institutions continue to function as well, but with their activities supervised or even directed by the junta. Other times, the junta rules formally and directly, maintaining legitimacy through a variety of other methods, most often promises of future democratization or of reclaiming lost land.\n\nUsually, a Military Junta takes power by coup d'état, though occasionally military leaders are invited to take control in times of crisis.

This party both serves as a mask to hide the nature of the regime, and a tool to serve the needs of the state. It rarely holds real political power, but can serve to advance skilled politicians to assist the dictator.\n\nThey are often created when power is centralized in the hands of a single person, who goes on to declare that for one reason or another, they would be holding that power permanently.

However, history has proven that they often fail to account for the unpredictability of human emotions, and such failure could easily lead to their downfall."

Far from pursuing democracy, Institutional Despotism aims to create and maintain a 'Perfect Dictatorship' that successfully convinces people they are not, in fact, in a dictatorship. As the new decade dawns, the most obvious case of this is the PRI rule in Mexico.\n\nIn this state, institutions are all controlled and subverted by a single, incredibly-entrenched oligarchical party or other such group occupying the political bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the government has dictatorial powers to enforce its will, powers enshrined in laws that give the state massive oversight and the faculties to intervene anywhere it pleases. Furthermore, even most of the organized opposition is likely directly controlled by, or a satellite of, the ruling party to give an illusion of political pluralism. Therefore, it is impossible to imagine their displacement from power without an immense broad-front effort directed specifically towards that goal.\n\nEvery action, inaction, use, and abuse is justified by a single unified goal or purpose inseparably tied to the ruling group or ideology—no matter how vague or logically incoherent said goal may become. The result is a despotism institutionalized and camouflaged, and a national ideology and civil society forced to revolve around an abstract goal absorbing everything that it touches—which is very frequently used to justify the self-interest of the political oligarchy that sits at its head."

In its earliest decades, the arbiter of Nazism was Adolf Hitler, summed up in the concept of "Führerprinzip": the Führer's word is the final word, and Nazism is whatever he says it is. But as time passed and Hitler's practical influence within the party waned, he could no longer enforce his will as the sole gatekeeper of National Socialist thought. One of the people who took advantage of that vacuum was Albert Speer.\n\nSpeer's National Socialist praxis is marked by a watering down of many of Hitler's more unsavory policies. The meticulous racial quantification, the futile quest for economic autarky, the endless empowerment of the military, even the blind worship of Hitler; Speer considers none of these tenets to be sacred and plans to do away with all of them. These inevitably earn him derision from his more devout rivals: he's a revisionist, he's a factionalist, he wants to replace Nazism with weak and effeminate Italian fascism. Some have even accused him of being a crypto-democrat who wants to destroy Nazism entirely.\n\nWhat they fail to realize is that Speer isn't reforming Nazism to destroy it, but to save it. By making ideological concessions in the name of pragmatism, Speer is able to amputate the gangrenous limb and keep the rest of the body alive. By limiting rampant militarism, he can diminish the risk of Caesarism in the general staff. And by allowing criticism of Hitler, he can preserve a cult of personality while maintaining the appearance of openness.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, Speer can transform National Socialism from a bloated mess of self-destructive contradictions into a workable ideology while preserving its core. There will still be a one-party state, there will still be racial purity, and most importantly, there will still be one all-powerful Führer."

It became deeply associated with Catholic and other religious traditionalism, integralism, and "clerical fascism" in the interwar years, and it served as a model to people such as Gabriele D'Annunzio, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Antonio Salazar.\n\nWhile corporatism is collectivist and believes economic classes are a fundamental unit of society it teaches that the greatest good can only be achieved through class collaboration rather than class struggle. Workers and employers alike are organized into some form of corporate body - be it guilds, syndicates, trade unions, or worker cooperatives - based on their industry, and it would be these corporate bodies that lobby the government on their behalf. The amount of representation the individual is afforded in the government is subject to variance, but usually often very little.

At the time, the movement's name and iconography were a tribute to the Arditi, Italy's elite assault corps and the very first to wear the black shirt - which would become the uniform of the future MVSN, the feared Camicie Nere.\n\nThe Sansepolcro Manifest advocated for a "Third Way" between capitalism and communism, taking the best from both sides while discarding what was deemed unnecessary. As such, early fascism conjugated private economic initiative with heavy state intervention in the economy, parity between sexes and worker uplifting programs with rabid nationalism and unbridled militarism, vote for women with single party state: a mèlange of political, social and economic beliefs, kept together by the messianic figure of the Duce, the voice of the people, who knew what was best for all - and had the strength to pursue it.\n\nAbandoned over the years in favor of less revolutionary policies that catered more to the middle classes, Sansepolcrismo has been brought back to the forefront of political discourse by Ettore Muti's meteoric rise to power. While unstable and somewhat erratic, it is undeniable that this ideology finds fertile ground among the lower classes and the military, making it a powerful tool to counter the advancement of socialism in society: only time will tell whether it will be successful, inaugurating a new age of nationalistic zeal and class cooperation, or it will once again be forgotten."

Preaching eternal devotion to the State, unflinching faith in God, and utter loyalty to one's family, comrades and brothers-in-arms, it is a comprehensive code of values that can find application in every moment of a person's life, replacing all other social constructs, including religion: in fact, Fascism is the final and logical conclusion of Christianity, with the messianic figure of the Duce acting as paragon of virtue, and supreme authority in both political and religious matters - making the corrupt and decadent Clergy unnecessary.\n\nPreviously confined to academic halls and theoretic debate, Niccolò Giani's meteoric rise to power in the Italian Empire has seen Fascist Mysticism experience a dramatic increase in both importance and adherents, as its teachings offer hope to desperate Italians: duty in place of uncertainty, and devotion in place of doubt.

Seeking to organize society around a system of syndicates, and promoting class cooperation instead of class struggle, it aims to constantly revolutionize itself, which means that it is, at least in theory, deeply progressive.\n\nNational Syndicalism, while still fairly popular in Latin American countries and a lingering influence on Spanish intellectuals, is not as voguish as it once was. Indeed: times have changed since the 1920s, and what was once seen as a young, fiery ideology has now been eclipsed by other radical currents, such as national socialism or communism. Nevertheless, a resurgence, while certainly unexpected, still seems to be possible, for National Syndicalism's perpetual modernisation might turn out to be its greatest strength."

Yet behind these apparently neutral calls for national unity and joint effort is a system no less fascistic than that first envisioned by Benito Mussolini, the Master of the Mediterranean, all those years ago: that of populist fascism.\n\nPopulist fascism is fascism for the farmers and peasants of the countryside - it focuses on the interests and welfare of the idealized "Old Country", far away from the alleged "decadence" and "corruption" inherent in cities and towns. As a result it focuses on the welfare of rural areas to an extent even many agrarian leftists and centrists would find irrational.\n\nPopulist fascism also eagerly plays on the neuroses and concerns of the average farmer to strengthen its base. An abhorrence for the "other", most frequently manifested in xenophobia and anti-Semitism, figures prominently in their policy. Just as important to them is well-deployed welfare - to ensure that farmers "can receive from the Nation their just reward for their work" - and protectionism, to shield the rural industries (whether deservedly or not) from their "hostile" competitors outside.\n\nThe loudest and most obvious example of populist fascism is Pierre Poujade of France; however, others like him do exist, and it is anyone's guess just how faithful he will be to the ideology he was so loudly promoting in 1962 and beforehand."

Why must they demonize the Germans, when their ideology clearly has unique characteristics that could better serve the forces of revolution?

At the close of the Great War, it had been a mere 60 years since the nation had begun its transformation from an isolated, feudal society to a modern and industrialized nation-state. No such change would be without teething problems, particularly in the field of economics - after all, the free-market status quo had originally developed naturally, over a lengthy period of time, and the arrival of revolutionary socialism only complicated matters further. From a combination of that era's uncertainties, ideological experimentation, and the new experience of colonialism emerged a uniquely Japanese phenomenon: 'kakushin kanryō', or 'Reform Bureaucracy'.\n\nFor such an unassuming name, Reform Bureaucracy carries quite the legacy of cruelty and exploitation. Best realized in the ruthlessly exploited puppet state of Manchukuo, it is unapologetically dehumanizing, corporatist, and even fascistic. To these bureaucrats, economics is a matter of nothing but numbers and well-trained cogs, a series of gears dedicated to expanding the nation's preparedness for war and mobilisation. Drawing upon the 'total war' economy of the late German Empire, the economic rationalization of the Weimar Republic, and the planned economy espoused by many hardline socialists, Reform Bureaucracy's ultimate goal is simple: the complete subordination of the economy to the needs of the state, generally with the military and a politicized bureaucracy as the main benefactors."

Insofar as its rhetoric concerns the well-being of the worker and his oppression by the forces of capital, Proletarian Nationalism is socialistic. In practice, however, Proletarian Nationalism wildly deviates from Marx's account of class antagonism; it is merely that its many strains differ as to whether workers' liberation should come through a corporatist, planned, or more traditionally socialist economic structure. These debates rage among a new class of fascists who, for the most part, view Marxism as a failure for which they have a superior vision.\n\nMany Proletarian Nationalists are ex-socialists who became disillusioned with mainstream socialism after Germany defeated the Soviet Union. Others are merely right-wing nationalists who learned to regurgitate half-understood socialist terminology. Still, most Proletarian Nationalists maintain that socialism must endure the scrutiny of fascist superpowers in order to survive. Socialism must, therefore, learn from fascist victories. Proletarian Nationalism is the ideological afterbirth of this transfusion. This new, purportedly proletarian movement inherits far more from fascism than from socialism, including authoritarian, prejudicial hierarchies hostile to traditional Marxist conceptions of democracy. \n\nIt seems ironic that people so dedicated to socialism would contort it so that, even if solely in vague allusions, it might survive. The Proletarian Nationalists seem desperate and confused. Perhaps, soon enough, they will realize their ideology is an excuse, an attempt to rationalize a tragic sequence that should not have been.

This ideology asserts that a nation is inherently interrelated with religion. The separation of faith and state is then completely erased, and policy takes a distinctly religious aspect. However, it still isn't a theocracy. Members of the clergy are not in positions of power, but the leader will be seen with high-ranking heads of religion. What organized religious movements exist will be subordinated to the state. On the subject of the history of the nation, Ecclesiastic Nationalists will emphasize the deep-rooted links between the nation and religion, often glorifying religious and pious figures, like Saint Sava of Serbia or Jeanne D'Arc of France.

With their patience gone, these party bureaucrats are yearning for the §Rreturn of the League of Blue Sky and White Sun§!.\n\nThe league was first created by §WChen Lifu§! with the permission of §WChiang Kai-Shek§! with the purpose of §Ycombating Communist agitation§! of youth and reinforcing the party organisation and guidelines. As per the tradition of Kuomintang, the League was a §Yresponse of the party§! to the creation of the §RBlueshirts§! in the army in order to balance out power. However, it was disbanded after tensions of the League and the Blueshirts reached intolerable levels.\n\nAlarmed by the loss of party identity, the CC members believe restoring the League is critical in recreating a §Rstrictly enforced, stratocratic party§!, which the League will have dictatorial control over. The organisation demands §Rabsolute loyalty to the leader§!, and the members are expected to §Rsacrifice liberty and even their own life§! if it means advancing the Party's agenda.\n\nCentral Club extremists absorbed much of Kuomintang theorist §WDai Chi-t'ao§!'s doctrine and are considered by Chinese and foreign observers as a proto-fascistic evolution of Dai and Chiang's authoritarian views §Yindependent of Italian Fascism§!."

To subjugate the importance of the Aryan people to the whims of a Führer, the cowardice of practicality, or even the confines of a German state is the height of folly. This is the National Socialist dream, and long has it laid idle at the foot of corrupt tyrants.\n\nThis sect of reformist National Socialists, led by Theodor Oberländer, seek to reform the German state and ideology around what they consider to be their ultimate purpose: the strengthening and preservation of the Aryan people as a whole. They advocate for rule by and representation of the Aryan person, more comprehensive racial policy to protect non-German Aryans, and a re-centering of the Reich's policies around its Aryan citizens."

Due to this, it has always been able to be adapted to fit the ideological needs and peculiarities of those wielding it even in the days when it was first adopted by Benito Mussolini. Given the widespread and still heavy influence of religion on millions worldwide, it is not surprising that many fascist movements ranging from the infamous Iron Guard of Romania to the Ustase of Croatia have attempted to wield faith and Fascism simultaneously in their quests for power and control over the very souls of their nations. The resulting child of this often-grotesque pairing is known to the world as Clerical Fascism.\n\nWhile religious influences within fascist movements is nothing out of the ordinary, these regimes tend to be extremists on par in their fanaticism with National Socialism. They are obsessed with theories of "salvation" that are bound inseparably with race and the nation in the minds of its practitioners. Unless their vision of purity is achieved, warn these modern-day zealots, their people will soon find themselves damned both here and in the afterlife.

From Speer's reformism to Oberländer's orthodoxy, National Socialism seemed to be split in different tendencies, all vying for power in the halls of the Reichstag. One tendency, however, stood out from the rest due to its main leader's vehemency: Joseph Goebbels' Stratocratic National Socialism.\n\nFirst devised by Goebbels at the beginning of the fifties, and then championed by such people as Ferdinand Schörner following the propagandist's untimely demise, it differs from traditional Nazism by calling for a greater emphasis on the national military. It advocates for measures such as harsh racial and antisemitic policies and a strict maintenance of eugenicism, along with the glorification of the concept of war. Extremely hawkish even among their Nazi consorts, they desire to adopt a hardline stance against the other great powers, and believe that the Cold War shall be won thanks to Blood and Iron."

Mostly popular in Germany's various colonies and Reichskommissariats, it is a form of governance that could best be described as a mix between reckless and ambitious industrialization and national socialist racialism.\n\nIn such a system, the various megacorporations which populate the German economic landscape are given quasi-free reign to do as they please, and the populations deemed as non-Aryan endlessly toil away in the mines or in the factories for what amounts to basically nothing. A tried-and-true system in the eyes of Germania's colonial bureaucrats, it allows for the exploitation of the East's riches while at the same time keeping the natives from revolting, because of the system's sheer brutality making quasi-impossible the organisation of a revolt: a perfectly adequate way to govern, one would think.\n\nAnd yet, some critics have arisen in Germany's hall of powers: from Speer's ragtag band of reformists, who argue that such an oppression of the Slavs is counterproductive, to some Burgundian adherents advocating for an agrarian society, it seems that Technocratic Nazism is at least somewhat polarizing within Germany proper."

However, it does draw inspiration from fascism's tenets. This inspiration can be seen in its organization of society into a totalitarian, corporatist structure, with the military firmly in charge. The rest of such a society is mobilized to support the military, and by extension the nation as a whole.\n\nStratocratic Corporatism can also take on other characteristics beyond its corporatist, totalitarian structure. Such governments frequently, although not necessarily, include elements of racial supremacy. This is not usually done through the pseudo-scientific exaltation of a master race, such as in Nazism. Instead, Stratocratic Corporatist societies usually stoke their racial supremacy through invoking a national spirit or mythology.\n\nTo such societies, peace is merely an interval in a never-ending chain of wars, and therefore the entirety of the nation's physical and moral resources must be forever poised for wartime mobilization. These governments frequently grapple with the issue of how to take independently minded masses and get them to look beyond their own issues and instead towards an abstract "destiny" of their nation. Compulsory membership in patriotic organizations, mobilizing marginal elements of society into the workforce, and the constant need for "token sacrifices" in the name of supporting their ever-growing military, nothing is beyond the reach of such regimes. Such nations can not lose, and the people hold faith in their governments that such statements shall remain true."

They say that the Reich, for all its faults, is not in need of anything more than reform or rejuvenation. They would see the status quo continue in perpetuity, leaving Germany as, ultimately, just another empire.\n\nFor Reinhard Heydrich and his followers in the Deutsche-SS, that is not enough. It will never be enough.\n\nWhile the Himmlerites delved into esotericism, and the Waffen-SS betrayed their cause for wealth and power, Heydrich and his devotees already had a vision of their own, far different from that of the corrupt NSDAP and degenerate liberals. It was one of a better, simpler, more pure society of the ancient past, where men were warriors, women were mothers, and all traces of profligacy and weakness were excised. No cities bubbling with filth; no "pragmatic" mercy for subhumans. In barracks-towns and country estates, the pure race drilled for war and worked the land, while their progeny was honed to perfection through purges and bloodshed. They were the Spartans, espoused in thrilling tones by Heydrich as the ancient manifestation of Aryan supremacy - and when the world revolves upon the axis of Germany, even history itself will bend to the Führer's will.\n\nIt falls to the true believers of National Socialism - the SS - to realize the promised land. Infused with the spirit of Sparta and forged anew upon the anvil of the Volksgemeinschaft, the Reich will be made eternal. Even if the blood must flow in rivers and overtake the sea; if countless millions must choke and die; if the foundations of utopia are laid upon the mass grave of all mankind; it will be worth it. One has not the luxury of counting the cost."

They rode the Reichsadler to the sunlit mountaintops past the storm clouds, where their fat sons now perch, preen, and awkwardly flap to steady their girth. National Socialism capitulated to business — it withered so it could fit the establishment, the subhuman. It became conservative. The National Socialist Revolution hung itself with its own rope.\n\nRevolutionary Nazism is an umbrella term for a niche, underground tendency within the global National Socialist movement. These scarce proselytizers of a diffuse ideology contend that the Reich is the stillborn child of a half-done revolution. Instead of creating a harmonious society, where business and labor are within the state, the Party Bureaucrats surrendered to capital. The growing wealth of Krupp, Siemens, and IG Farben at the expense of the Aryan worker is a symptom of a cancer festering deep within the bitter, cynical husk that reigns over Germania.\n\nThe precise makeup of this ideal National Socialist economy is a contested subject even among Revolutionary Nazis. Still, whether one man argues for guild-based corporatism, and another for a planned economy, there is the underlying agreement that the riches thereof belong to the whole Aryan nation. No Jew should claim a share, for his inferior race precludes him. And whether a Revolutionary Nazi draws on distorted Marxist rhetoric, the writings of Völkisch activists, or even the once-blasphemy of Ernst Röhm, the image of a skyward sword fills his mind.\n\nNo more half measures. No more backroom deals in smoky dens. No more crypto-Jews. By the chisel or by the cannon, by speech or by treatise, with the hammer or with the sword, the National Socialist Revolution will grow to shade the planet in the titanic shape of the Aryan worker."

It declared that Colombia's Criollos, men and women of European or mestizo ancestry, were the master race of not only Colombia, but all of the Americas, on equal footing with the Aryan race in Germany. Enraptured by the success of the European Aryan in the Second World War, those who follow Ariocriollismo have proclaimed their undying loyalty to Germany, and seek to emulate their success in Colombia, the land of the Criollos.\n\nThe Ariocriollismo doctrine states that in order to awaken the Aryan residing within every Criollo, they must follow a strict path of discipline, enlightenment, and virtue, the axes of the ideology and the road to realizing their innate superiority. These virtues, which lead to the Aryan awakening, involve Criollos recognizing their superior European heritage and adopting the methods of the first-emancipated nation, Germany.\n\nWhile Colombia and its people may not be of a singular race or color, the concept of Criollo extends far beyond such constricting categories. Any white or mestizo Colombian can arise from their slumber and claim the mantle of Ariocriollo. However, for races such as the Afro-Colombian and the Indigenous, it is impossible for them to unlock the Aryan potential of a Criollo. The best they can aspire to do is to willingly assimilate themselves into Ariocriollo culture and traditions, thereby earning them the prefix of 'Virtuous' before their race. The only other option is to be enslaved. And for the so-called 'Enemy Races' residing within Colombia? Their only options are escape or extermination, for the vile Judaeans and foreigners are impediments to the Ariocriollo dream and Colombia's future."

However, over time they were corrupted by deceitful Jewish interference, who manipulated them into intermarrying with lesser races and covered up their glorious heritage. Their descendants, who have fallen far but may regain their former glory, are now known as the German people.\n\nSlavo-Aryanists would agree with everything above, but replace "German" with "Slavic." To them, it is the Russians who are the heirs of the all-powerful Aryan race, and the Germans are actually inferior Asiatics who occupied Aryan lands at the behest of the Jew. But beyond that, they quibble plenty over all the details. They disagree on the Aryan race's point of origin: some say the Russian heartlands, some say the far north, some say a lost landmass that inspired the story of Atlantis, and some say the Levant. They are solidly anticlerical and believe that Christianity is a tool of the Jew to undermine the soul of Russia, but they bicker about the proper spelling of Perun and the canonicity of Hindu Vedas.\n\nWhen it comes to coherent economic and political theory, they have none. The ancient Aryans did not need to know about GDP or postclassical realism to achieve their perfect society, so why should they bother learning it today? The only aspect that truly matters is war, a total war, one that will reinvigorate the Russian spirit and reawaken the blood of the Aryan that flows through the vein of every Slav. And when the last Jew is strangled with the guts of the last German, they claim, the Aryan race shall be restored once more."

Through both preparing for and actually doing so, the 'passionarity,' or overall drive, of this ethnic grouping will be maximized, allowing for greatness to be achieved on a societal scale.\n\nThis concept naturally encourages an extremely militant approach towards its implementation, with maximal distrust of and aggression towards any ethnic grouping not considered Eurasian, whether that be foreign entities or domestic minorities that must, in time, be cleansed in some fashion in order to protect the super-ethnos.

In addition, and in order to sustain their military administration, such governments typically display extreme aggression on the world stage, towards both neighboring states as well as those considered state enemies, for reasons of history, political expediency, or others as determined.

Diplomacy, especially with those seen as sympathetic to their doctrinal enemies, is extremely difficult, when possible at all.

When those men returned home, they could not reconcile the grand narratives for which they had fought with the reality of the world they had shaped. Modernity had conspired against them. They found no clarity of vision, they found no unity in strength. The romance of the soldier's return was a fiction. The romance of soldierly virtues was a fiction. Subjectivity usurped certitude. As time passed, there were more revolutions, more humiliations. More moralizing from materialistic creatures that could only breed in total vacuity. More traditions thrown to dogs. More suffering for it. More of the same, though without sameness.\n\nReactionary Nationalism proposes that nations must return to a past state of social organization in order to cast off the spiritual malaise enforced by twentieth-century modernity. This structure is typically picked from a narrow, romanticised slice of time in that nation's history, though it can also relate to methods for the violent transposition of antiquated moral norms onto colonies and other realms of empire. The policies born thereof are more frequently annihilationist than assimilationist, for Reactionary Nationalists believe that homogeneity is a prerequisite of nationhood.\n\nReactionary Nationalism is warlike and exclusive by nature. It must be, in order to satisfy the perverted heroism it proselytizes. Reactionary Nationalists believe that they seek justice by making the world as it should be, informed by the inalienable truth that some men are superior, and some men are inferior. But the lot of these self-styled knights is to fit virtues that never existed, or to force people who only know modernity to mold themselves into figures in gilded paintings. Starved of defined ideology, Reactionary Nationalism attaches itself to a superficial aesthetic, or the image of a knight in armor, visor down, and sword upright, so that any statesman may imagine himself as an emissary of return.\n\nBut the lie does not matter.
