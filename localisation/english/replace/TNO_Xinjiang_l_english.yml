 Where_Are_They_desc: "Counter-bandit warfare is supposedly one of the key roles of the Governate-General, but it is now increasingly apparent that the Sheng regime has not necessarily eliminated insurgents. The ranks of the Communists grow by the day, living off mountains and woods in the shadow. Though the urban centres are firmly subservient, Large swaths of northern Xinjiang are in anarchy.

 Faded_Modern_Civilization_desc: "Xinjiang, alongside northern parts of Central Asia, were integral to the Siberian Plan, and the province reaped great benefits by tying its economy with the Soviet Union. Such an arrangement collapsed very quickly after the Russian surrender, leaving Xinjiang's export-oriented industry bankrupt overnight. Many a machine tool lies idle in rusted factories, recollecting times of glory that was going to transfer to Xinjiang. Years after the economic collapse, these tarnished metal giants lie in slumber still as monuments to what once was. Modern, industrialised civilisation looked upon the Northwest and found it wanting."

 Orphan_of_Asia_desc: "Sheng's rapprochement of the Co-Prosperity Sphere was out of optimism. While the Japanese are incapable of reaching his province, it would at least not deny chances to further expansion of its influence into Central Asia.\nDespite repeated attempts, the Empire displays no interest in Xinjiang, where the hostile environment and lack of control of the countryside mean no natural resource exploitation would go on without great threats to the security of Japanese investments. It remains a question whether Xinjiang should continue courting with Japan or seek some other benefactors."

 TAF.1.t: "The New Year Speech"
 TAF.1.d: "Yuandan - January 1, the first day of the New Year in the Gregorian calendar. Since Sun Yat-sen first used it in his oath of office in 1912, it has been regarded as a symbol of civilization, along with the traditional Lunar New Year.It was on this morning that Sheng Shi was due to deliver his New Year's radio address, and it was on this day that the governor could make his voice heard by the people of Xinjiang under his rule. Tens of thousands of radios have tuned their frequencies for this purpose, waiting for the jade tone of Dihua to come out.\n\n Before walking to the microphone, Sheng Shicai stopped at the mirror again to check his outfit. There are still five minutes to go before the transmission begins, and the Di Hua headquarters is making the final confirmation of the signal. There is still plenty of time. There is no need to hurry. The collars and cuffs were pressed straight, as he had expected, and the purely decorative pen was pinned to his chest. The prefect's wardrobe was impeccable. Although his audience was destined not to see him in public, Sheng relished the process, and every time he looked, he got closer to the perfect governor.\n\n "You are very well dressed today." The assistant smiled obsequiously and handed over his prepared speech.\n\n -- he already knew that. Sheng Shicai reached out his hand to take the notes and walked toward the open microphone. The sound of shoes stomping on the floor could be heard from the broadcasting equipment set aside."
 TAF.1.a: "The year 1962 has come. From Dihua, I extend New Year greetings to the people of all Xinjiang......"
 TAF.2.t: "The Porter"
 TAF.2.d: "Sayram stuffed his hands into his worn-out jacket, eyes wide open yet aimless. The sun has yet to reveal itself, and few rays of twilight can be spared for labourers like him, congregating in small groups along the road, bidding their time. Though not the most ideal condition to spend much of the freezing night, only those who persist may succeed, for nothing awaits him and his family otherwise other than a slow and painful death. \n\nA far from where the labourers conversed, a slender figure appeared on the horizon, his back against the starry night, and his lengthy shadow cast upon the gravel road. The labourers moved not, but their sight fixates on the stranger as the eagles prey, till the stranger came to a full stop. \n\n'5 heads, a hundred grand per man!' Though his words are short and without care, the stranger was quickly surrounded by the waiting workers. Seldom does a day's worth of food and cheap cigarettes come so easily, and even the most sickly stood up and came to the employer. Hardly feeling his legs, Sayram nevertheless strode with his limbs awkwardly moving forward, though the Northwestern breeze has gotten the best of him years ago. His joints aching as he goes, his face braces the punishing currents sharper than razors. \n\nBefore he'd make out the face of that stranger, he was already on his way with a few able-bodied, pushing through the crowd, with no one stopping or interjecting, and the noise dying down as fast as it came into existence. After a few minutes, the station was as it is, no less despairing and pitiful, as the men have endured.\n\nSayram's chest trembles, and every beat of his heart is a struggle. His thought stray from that of his previous ventures, about the unbearable summers and the cotton fields he'd laboured. His sight fails him as the freezing wind assaults him. Reapers waiting for his demise. It won't be much longer now, he thought to himself, should the sun be shy today."
 TAF.2.a: "This is our fate..."
 TAF.2.b: "When would these evil days come to an end!"
 TAF.3.t: "A Day in Railway Station"
 TAF.3.d: "The philosophy of escapism has worked out well for Abduwal, and every day the man'd repeat unto himself to cherish what he has in the present rather than what was to avoid meaningless contemplation and suffering, such that he won't have a past to compare to. Though quite the stoic, his occupation guaranteed every now and then memories of the past slip by his mind. \n\nYears ago, crystal-clear screeches of train whistles would awake him every now and then, even on the latest of nights. Though he never rested properly, Abduwal loved conversing with train drivers over life and what went on in the west, and the weight of those linen bags they'd hand over to him for taxes, a great portion of which would be his to keep. Life was busy and rest was scarce, but at least something new was happening every day, satisfying the curiosity of a man stationed off in remote lands far away from his family.\n\nAt first, Abduwal was surprised by the trains missing the schedules. Though mounted bandits are known to interfere with how things flow around, Soviet behemoths of steel aren't something the Uyghurs or the Hans dared to rob. As days turned into months and months into years, all he'd found out from his old radio was the dissolution of the Union, and no trains came ever since. Though Abduwal appreciates the lack of interruption to his sleep, the Uyghur often finds himself awakened to insect chitchatting. \n\nHe'd run out, gazing upon the horizon to the west with hope, only to see nothing but the stars, as if mocking his naivety. He'd learnt to fall asleep again by staring at the clock, ever reminding him of the passing of time and his slow but inevitable destitution. He could bring himself to sleep not tonight, and something must be done to occupy his troubled mind a little. He thought of patrolling the surrounding area, but the freezing winds of Dzungaria forced him back into his prefab the second. The kerosene light on his desk flickers, reminding him of something.\n\nThe pages fly by, hardened and yellowed. \n\nIt could have been a lot worse, he thought to himself, before picking up the pen."
 TAF.3.a: "'Yining station, 4th February 1962. Windy. No arrivals.'"
 TAF.4.t: "Warehous Inspection"
 TAF.4.d: "Chen Yonggui has long considered himself more of an adventurer rather than a lowly security guard, checking around the same, abandoned compound day after day. He treads carefully along the same path, so as to not step onto other parts of the floor thickly coated by dust. As if harbouring an intense hatred of him, the building has nothing to offer but unreflective machinery and abandoned wires ready to trip him over at any moment.\n\n 'Let's just be done with it and move on, not a ghost would wander in these stupid places…' The other worker following Chen's coughs broke his thought. 'Mr Ma is hosting a dinner tonight, we have something better.' The young man coughs violently, inhaling the dust he'd set off with his careless steps.\n\n 'Huh, where he'd have the money for that?'\n\n'The Governor-General. Says it's a reward for him fixing the wires for the radios, not that I know what he…'\n\n'That? If they'd reward someone for fixing a switch or two those dogshit forgot, I don't want to imagine with who did Sheng staff the government!' Chen lands a heavy kick on a loosened roll of wires as the younger man watched in silence, not daring to interrupt his superior.\n\n'I know your heart's already there, your asses aren't needed around here, if that'd shut you up well for tonight.' \n\n'Aye, sir! ' The youngster stood at attention and saluted Chen with his discoloured cap before hastily disappearing with the sound of a heavy slam of the metal gates, leaving Chen himself, his face only dimly illuminated by his cigarette, yet the wrinkles of time are no less visible.\n\nHe has always felt the parts are calling for him and pushing him away, though he'd not understand what half of them are for. Though the stuff of urban legend, Chen looks upon these places with mixed feelings. These metallic ghosts of a bygone age are yet to be laid to rest, buried in a hurry to sit here for what will be an eternity with no purpose."
 TAF.4.a: "Not that Chen'd care about, so long he is paid."

 taf.world.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Sikiang is on edge"
 taf.world.1.d: "Sheng Shicai's Xinjiang is delving into total anarchy as significant unnamed units were reportedly crossing the Kazakh-Xinjiang border into northern parts of the province, occupying the towns of Ili and Tacheng with the assistance of roaming Communist bands which have already stretched local governmentsresources thinly.\n\nAs the conflict threatens the city of Dihua itself, the existence of the status quo in Central Asia is likely shifting in favour of Soviet remnants.Despite these turbulent courses of events, little news has come out of Dihua, for a recent attempt on Sheng's life has put him in critical condition."
 taf.world.1.a: "Most curious indeed"
 taf.world.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Communists Win the Sikiang Civilwar"
 taf.world.2.d: "The death of the late Governor-General of Xinjiang and the fall of Dihua recently marked the end of a thirty-year-long regime. Red banners proudly bearing hammers and sickles now fly over the city confirming the concrete takeover of the Communists.\n\nLed by Chen Tanqiu, the so-called Xinjiang Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party would not have been able to overthrow the authority if not for the assistance of Communist Uyghur and Kazakh columns. Though Xinjiang is now once more unified, analysts in Asia believe that this turn of events will not impact regional geopolitics too greatly, as regime changes do not sweep aside existing ethnic and economic problems. Nevertheless, Communist groups around the world acknowledge this success as one of the first victories of the International Left since the dissolution of the Soviet Union."
 taf.world.2.a: "Most curious indeed"
 taf.world.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Sikiang Government Collapsed"
 taf.world.3.d: "The Governate-General of Xinjiang endures still as the remnants of provincial administration managed to fend off would-be red successors to Sheng Shicai’s legacy. The secession of left-wing Uyghur formations initially allied to the Communists rapidly deteriorated their position, and the previous administration has now re-established itself in Turpan with the assistance of the Imperial Japanese Army despite losing Dihua itself. \n\nAcross other regions of the New Frontiers, local communities have taken up lordship, fracturing much of the region. Though conflict has largely stalled, so did peace talks. It is expected that without external intervention, Xinjiang would remain in pieces in foreseeable future."
