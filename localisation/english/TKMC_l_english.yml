KMC_THENEWORDER_DESC: "In the ensuing chaos following the collapse of the Soviet Union, we found ourselves the last remaining Fleet, with Arkhangelsk, Leningrad and all ports on the Black Sea falling to the fascist invader we remained the sole inheritor of the proud Soviet Naval Tradition. Pledging our loyalty to Yagoda’s regime, as the legitimate continuation of the USSR we served for a time from Vladivostok continuing routine maritime patrol missions and guarding the ever decreasing Russian shipping coming in and out of our ports. With the Japanese backed invasion of the Far East by their Fascist puppets we faced a stark choice, fight and die or preserve what was left of the fleet. With no prospect of victory in the face of the overwhelming power of the Japanese Navy, Admiral Ivan Yumashev made the decision to evacuate north to the Kamchatka Peninsula. Basing ourselves out of the then mostly abandoned port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the small port down has gradually grown with our presence. Without the support of a larger government the prospect of maintaining even our small navy became more difficult. With a small population, no industry to speak of and no outside support we had no other option than to turn to Piracy and Smuggling. \n\nNow a sad excuse for a navy the warships rarely raid themselves, instead preferring to operate from converted fishing, or cargo vessels to avoid suspicion, with the warships often found sitting in port, rusting and slowly falling apart. As our ships decay so do the spirits of the men. Over time more and more of our veterans perished or left of their own accord, often making off with one of our ships to operate on their own out of another village elsewhere in the peninsula, refusing to hand over their loot to the good of the fleet. \n\nWhat is left is a band of the aging old guard, and young men and boys who have often only joined the fleet to escape crushing poverty, hoping to chance their luck on a raid or aboard a smuggling ship. There are those in the fleet who hope for change however, Veteran Admiral Grigory Shchedrin and devout Communist, Captain Ivan Maslennikov believe that the fleet must rebuild its Professional Core and reignite its spirit as a defender of the Soviet Motherland. Should they wish to achieve their goals, it will be necessary to rely on, or even increase our efforts towards Piracy and Smuggling if they hope to fund this."

KMC_frozen_east:0 "Frozen East"
KMC_frozen_east_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, then the Remnant Government in Siberia we have been stuck on our own in Kamchatka. Living off the land as best we could, and the sea ever so slightly better, what was once a strong and proud navy has been reduced to banditry and piracy just to survive. While some from the old days remain, many of the members of the Fleet never served in the Old Union’s Navy, instead, having joined as their only opportunity at escaping poverty, or just in search of plunder. \n\nEvery day the remnant fleet looks less like a cohesive navy and more like a band of common pirates, every day our traditions and practices are being eroded further and further, all the while our ships are slowly decaying, missing important parts and expertise for repair. If we hope to regain control of the fleet and root out this rot serious action must be taken."
KMC_we_do_what_we_must:0 "We Do What We Must"
KMC_we_do_what_we_must_desc:0 "While shameful, smuggling is certainly profitable. Over our time in the region we have made connections with several different groups, be they Alaskan, Manchurian, Chinese or Hawaiian, everyone has something they want and it turns out most of them want what each other have. Be they dissident groups in the Sphere wanting weapons, Or American exporters looking to access Japanese markets, our fleet of ships (though ageing) can act as a middleman for those looking to avoid the American-Japanese Trade Embargo or acquire more illicit goods. We will make sure to take a share of the profits for our troubles of course."
KMC_to_save_men:0 "To Save Men"
KMC_to_save_men_desc:0 "We must keep the tradition alive. While ships are the body of our navy, our men are our soul, our tradition. As long as there is an unbroken line, passed on from the old guard to the new, we can continue to call our fleet the Red Navy. All we do is to preserve that lineage, whatever the cost may be."
KMC_we_take_what_is_necessary:0 "We Take what is Necessary"
KMC_we_take_what_is_necessary_desc:0 "Running a navy requires oil and all manner of supplies to keep both men and ships in working order, none of which are produced here in Kamchatka. With no prospect of them developing natively in the area we must source them from outside. Unfortunately, because of said lack of industry or resources, we have nothing to exchange for them so we need to acquire them through other means. Fortunately, the Pacific is full of stray ships weighed down with oil, weapons, and other useful supplies. Often coming from wealthy nations such as Japan or America they can afford to share a small portion of their cargo with those who need it more. As long as we are careful we can get what we need without antagonising the Great Powers too much."
KMC_to_save_ships:0 "To Save Ships"
KMC_to_save_ships_desc:0 "A navy without any warships can barely call itself a navy. Without adequate facilities to build new ships, at any reasonable rate or standard at least, we must preserve what we have. Ten submarines, Four destroyers, and our flagship, the battleship Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya. They are ageing but not dead. While these ships still float, and there are men to crew them, the spirit of the old union lives on."
KMC_secure_our_position:0 "Secure our Position"
KMC_secure_our_position_desc:0 "Putting aside the prospect of an intervention from American or Japan, which we would have no hope of repelling, we are relatively secure in our position by sea, with no other local power having any sizable navy that could hope to challenge ours, despite its poor shape. Although the forests, mountains, and sheer size and remoteness of our land offer good natural protection, it may still be prudent to consider the defence of our northern regions. While in terrible shape compared to our glory days, the plunder and supplies we bring in from our raids and smuggling missions leave us relatively well off for this part of Russia. Should any upstart band of robbers or resurgent force in the area come knocking, we should be prepared.\n\nDue to the advantageous terrain such an effort should be relatively inexpensive, if we are intelligent and build our defences to incorporate natural barriers we could undertake such an effort cheaply and quickly."
KMC_the_plan:0 "Shchedrin's Grand Plan"

KMC_appeal_to_america:0 "Appeal to America"
KMC_appeal_to_america_desc:0 "America is nothing if it is not opportunistic, and we have a proposal that can deliver them a victory on multiple fronts, while of course giving us exactly what we want. They have been funding the fascist dogs in Magdan for some time now, we know as much as a not-insignificant amount of the supplies sent to them has found its way into our care. If we were to ask for American assistance to leave, safe passage guaranteed through the Panama canal, along with the opportunity to dock in ports of OFN member states we would be out of their hair for good, and their lapdogs in Magdan would be able to expand into this godforsaken peninsula. They would also be grateful to have the red army and navy finally reunited in Arkhangelsk strengthening the Front's position against Germany. After all, whether fascist or communist they will back whoever can best give the Germans a good beating, with our offer it seems they can hedge their bets."
KMC_assess_our_assets:0 "Assess our Air Assets"
KMC_assess_our_assets_desc:0 "Along with the ageing warships in our possession, we have a small number of planes. Although they haven’t flown in years, it could be useful to see if any of them still fly. They will come in useful spotting potential targets, patrolling our coast, or maybe even as smuggling vessels. That is of course if we can find anyone brave enough to go up in one."
KMC_deal_with_professionalism_crisis:0 "Deal with the Professionalism Crisis"
KMC_deal_with_professionalism_crisis_desc:0 "Our Fleet's Cohesion and Professionalism has decayed to unacceptable levels. Our Junior Officers and Sailors must be brought back into line, with the standards and conduct befitting of the Red Fleet. Mutinies, electing officers, and keeping plunder from the Fleet must all be clamped down on hard. Shchedrin’s plans will seek to bring about both an increase in standards and a change of methods, both, he claims are necessary not only to carry out Operation Ithaca but to survive as a navy if we hope to reintegrate with the WRRF."
KMC_reintroduce_naval_commissars:0 "Reintroduce Naval Commissasrs"
KMC_reintroduce_naval_commissars_desc:0 "Ivan Maslennikov, one of the loudest communist voices in the fleet, has proposed the reintroduction of Naval Commissars to the fleet. He sees the gradual abandonment of the role as a direct cause of the fleet’s slip in standards. By bringing back the Commissars, he claims, we will be able to instil in the men the sense of a greater cause, and more importantly, bring back some much needed discipline.\n\nThis would shift the fleet back towards a more Communist system, at least on the surface level, which has naturally raised some eyebrows with those who are becoming comfortable with the current state of affairs. This should, however, be of little concern to us, as they are precisely whose influence we hope to shatter."
KMC_the_problem_of_plunder:0 "The Problem of Plunder"
KMC_the_problem_of_plunder_desc:0 "It seems we have no shortage of plunder, the problem is more making sure it gets back into the Fleet’s hands. Far too often does a crew head out on a raid never to return, likely having made off with the loot themselves to start a new life somewhere far better than here. It is also not unheard of for our officers to keep loot for themselves, bribing their crews with a smaller portion for their silence and never declaring it to the fleet.\n\nWe may need to do a bit of bribing ourselves. In order to build up trust and loyalty with the crews, we should codify exactly what each man is entitled to, and exactly what should be handed back to the fleet. Hopefully, with a stronger system, every man will know what he stands to gain by sticking with the Fleet."
KMC_investigate_the_quatermasters:0 "Investigate the Quartermasters"
KMC_investigate_the_quatermasters_desc:0 "Determining who is owed what in principle is one thing, making sure it is put into practice is another. The Quartermasters run their own kingdom in the warehouses, getting the final say over who is allocated which supplies, and more importantly keeping an inventory of exactly what they have in store. We should use our newfound Political Officers to investigate and oversee the Quartermasters, removing the worst offenders and reigning in those that can be brought to heel. The Fleet can not have a cadre of bureaucrats undermining it at every turn."
KMC_make_our_move:0 "Make our Move"
KMC_make_our_move_desc:0 "The time is now. From our reforms, we are starting to see real changes. More ships are returning will cargo holds full of plunder, more of this plunder is making its way back to the fleet, and more of that plunder is making it to the places where it is most needed. Despite our best efforts, some hold outs remain, often groups of ex sailors and mutineers, who have left the fleet with all of their experience and continue to operate out of remote bases. We will begin planning an operation to wipe out these pirates, unassociated with the fleet. Any other group operating on the peninsula puts our plans in Jeopardy. We must assemble our best men to raid these thugs and stamp out these robbers once and for all."
KMC_naval_infantry:0 "Naval Infantry Lessons"
KMC_naval_infantry_desc:0 "While the Fleet is excellent at projecting power and bringing in supplies, if it wants to reach further inland it must rely on our ever-dependable Naval Infantry. They have performed admirably in the exercises and we have learned much. It is time to put those lessons into practice."
KMC_theory:0 "Lessons from the Exercises"

KMC_practice:0 "Naval Engineers"
KMC_practice_desc:0 "Weather blowing up obstacles, or putting up bridges we have found our Naval Engineer detachments invaluable to the success of our Infantry. We should increase the resources available to these detachments to ensure their continued success."
KMC_tactics:0 "Weapons Review"
KMC_tactics_desc:0 "The Exercises have proved what worked well and what is ineffective in the terrain we find ourselves in. We should conduct a short review of the weapons currently at the disposal of the fleet to determine which areas are best to focus on in the future."
KMC_security_service:0 "A Security Service"
KMC_security_service_desc:0 "Naval Commissars are all well and good, but it may also be prudent to operate a less visible agency to watch over the fleet's activities. In establishing an intelligence agency we will create a system of anonymous informants to keep tabs on their compatriots both on land and at sea. Where the Commissar’s power comes from their presence, to deter any overt disloyalty, the power in our new agency will be its invisibility. No sailor will know who any potential informant could be. No Captain will know which of his officers he can conspire with to hide plunder. No Quartermaster will be able to bribe a warehouse worker. We will be in all places, and wherever our ships travel in the Pacific, so will our eyes."
KMC_tighten_rules_of_engagement:0 "Tighten Rules of Engagement"
KMC_tighten_rules_of_engagement_desc:0 "Up until now, despite raids often being ordered by the fleet there has been little guidance for exactly how ships should go about such raids. It has been a long time since we have operated with any coherent doctrine. While some captains take a non-violent approach, some especially more hot-headed ones in command of our military vessels decide to go in all guns blazing, or even worse lead with a torpedo. Not only is this often counterproductive, but it will also only seek to draw further ire from the great powers, and violent methods will force ships to defend themselves to an ever greater degree. As such we will enshrine rules of engagement that all crews must follow, for the safety of themselves, the speedy conclusion of all raids, and avoidance of any retribution from outside actors."
KMC_increase_training_standards:0 "Increase Training Standards"
KMC_increase_training_standards_desc:0 "Due to our desperate situation, we have for too long been willing to take in whoever was willing to serve. Often sailors will be brought in and sent out with very little training. If we are to recover our Professional core that needs to train now. We need to ensure our men have been adequately trained to face any eventuality they come across at sea. \n\nThis will have two main benefits. Firstly, our doctrine of rapid, non-lethal raids will be more effectively carried out by a trained crew, and secondly having undergone a more rigorous training regime we can better instil what it is to be a sailor in the Red Fleet. No more will any old ruffian be able to join our ranks, potential sailors must earn their place."
KMC_review_the_networks:0 "Review the Networks"
KMC_review_the_networks_desc:0 "While our smuggling networks have proven to be our most reliable source of supplies over these past years, like all aspects of the Fleet, inefficiency and corruption plague the networks. Officers and men taking their own personal cuts, unprofitable routes and unnecessary risks all need to be routed out to improve the system. It would be wise to conduct a review to determine which areas are the most profitable and assess if there are any opportunities that we are not yet taking advantage of. We need to take whatever chances we can get out here."
KMC_contacts_in_alaska:0 "Contacts in Alaska"
KMC_contacts_in_alaska_desc:0 "Alaska has a significant oil industry, and oil, more precisely fuel, is something we are in desperate need of. Fortunately, we are not alone, Japan and her puppets, while in possession of some sources of oil have hungry fleets and hungry industries. Although we would struggle to pay for the oil by ourselves, if we act as a middle man connecting Japanese businesses with American Oil Magnates willing to look past political differences we can ferry this oil out of America and hopefully keep a small cut for our troubles."
KMC_contacts_in_manchuria:0 "Contacts in Manchuria"
KMC_contacts_in_manchuria_desc:0 "With a significant industry, a strong partisan network, and a vast nation, Manchuria offers plenty of opportunities to expand our smuggling networks. Whether they want to sell off surplus to fund other activities or need weapons quickly we can connect them with various other groups across the Pacific who would be more than willing to trade. Although a relatively dangerous activity trying to bypass Japanese security hunting both them and us, we can use some of our native sailors to pose as local fishermen to hopefully avoid suspicion. The Japanese are bound not to notice."
KMC_sourcing_supplies:0 "Sourcing Supplies"
KMC_sourcing_supplies_desc:0 "Food, electronics, parts, clothes, tools, cigarettes of course and a whole host of goods are required to keep our operation afloat. While we cannot source these from any one location, the connections we have made so far inevitably put us in touch with others who wish to expand their businesses despite the Japanese-American Embargo. If they are willing to pay us in kind we are more than willing to take the risks connecting them with their potential customers."
KMC_repair_efforts:0 "Repair Efforts"
KMC_repair_efforts_desc:0 "While some would see our ageing ships as a curse, the vast majority of our command structure included they do come with some small silver linings. Although our facilities would be woefully unequipped to handle and repair more modern, thankfully what we have is more than adequate for current maintenance needs. Alongside that, due to their frequent problems in their old age, our dockworkers and engineers have become well accustomed to working with our Fleet and have become adept at patching the various shortcomings and common problems. That said, there is only so much we can do, and they are not miracle workers. Should the ships fall into a state of serious disrepair there would be little hope for them."
KMC_convert_captured_ships:0 "Convert Captured Ships"
KMC_convert_captured_ships_desc:0 "Though our common practice is to take a small portion of a ship’s cargo and send them on their way, we do occasionally come into possession of a new ship, often courtesy of one of our Captain’s over-eagerness or the other ship’s Captain’s belligerence in the face of our men. Either way, these would make good ships to add to our smuggling fleet. With some minor alterations to allow for hidden compartments, or disguising them as local vessels they will no doubt soon become productive easily paying for our efforts converting them. Besides, there is never a shortage of desperate men out here willing to risk their lives for a small chance at a profit."
KMC_administering_the_system:0 "Administering the System"
KMC_administering_the_system_desc:0 "As our network grows, so does the administrative effort required to keep tabs on it all. We should move some of our more logistically minded officers away from general duties to administrative duties to ensure the system continues to run smoothly and profitably. As our experience grows, we can continue to look for new opportunities and potential sources of income. "
KMC_finding_a_buyer:0 "The Pacific Black Market"
KMC_finding_a_buyer_desc:0 "Although our smuggling efforts started to secure the basic necessities we have assembled a relatively large network. In most ports across the Pacific, we can find a sympathetic official willing to look the other way, or a local ‘legitimate businessman’ who gleefully awaits our next ship. Wherever our ships go, unattainable American or Japanese goods follow. As a result, an emerging Black Market is beginning to appear with us at the centre of the web. While not intended this could provide a serious source of supplies, much needed in the planning of our operation. Hopefully, they won’t miss us too much when we are gone."
KMC_more_efficient_routes:0 "Improve Route Efficiency"
KMC_more_efficient_routes_desc:0 "There are always improvements to be made. Looking back in the months since we began to seriously expand our operations, although we have come far there is still much to do. Now we have grown in size there are opportunities for streamlining and better allocation of resources. "
KMC_factory:0 "Sourcing our Own Equipment"
KMC_factory_desc:0 "While relying on captured American and Japanese weapons has provided us well so far it has proved unreliable. Establishing some basic industry, no matter how small scale will at least provide some basic degree of stability."
KMC_dockyard:0 "Port Development"
KMC_dockyard_desc:0 "The expansion of our smuggling fleet should be matched with an expansion of our dockyards. While we do not expect the expansion to be of long term use in building new ships, it will provide valuable capacity for necessary repairs and maintenance, allowing for us to have more of our fleet at sea at any one time."
KMC_more_convoys:0 "Requisition Civilian Ships"
KMC_more_convoys_desc:0 "As our activities have expanded so have the ships in our possession, more of these should be introduced into service in our smuggling network."
KMC_a_legitimate_state:0 "A Legitimate State"
KMC_a_legitimate_state_desc:0 "If we have any hope of the Americans even considering corporations we need to convince them we are more than just a glorified gang of thieves and smugglers. Granted they would be forgiven for thinking that based on the activities the fleet has been forced to resort to, so it falls on us to demonstrate that we are a serious actor in the area. While our legitimacy as the continuation of the Red Navy is indisputable, we should prove that we are a legitimate state too, perhaps by implementing some token political reforms and giving some small scale representation to locals in civilian government or not. Whether this civilian government has any power or even exists in reality is just a formality."
KMC_safe_passage_for_americans:0 "Safe Passage for Americans"
KMC_safe_passage_for_americans_desc:0 "Regardless of the overtures we make to America, the elephant in the room will undoubtedly be our past and continued raiding against their ships.  Although we can’t take back the past, the sooner we end the raids against Americans the further away the past will be. As a result, Admiral Yumashev will issue an order, effectively immediately, that all raids against American ships will cease. Any crew found to have engaged in piracy of American owned ships, or in possession of stolen American goods will face immediate Court Martial, and the judges will not be lenient."
KMC_finding_an_in:0 "Finding an In"
KMC_finding_an_in_desc:0 "One rather significant problem still remains in our plans to gain American aid for our Operation. We have no contacts in the American government. Fortunately, we may have a solution. One of our Captains who frequently travels to America on smuggling missions claims to have a connection to the American Intelligence Services. How he came into such powerful friends is not clear, it is equally not clear as to why this connection has not been revealed before but it is a lead we can’t afford to ignore."

Ivanov will act as our contact between the Fleet and the CIA, due to the American’s wishes to keep our cooperation secret he will be removed from his current duties and given the role as our unofficial Naval Attache to America. He will continue to travel to America on smuggling ships as before, however, when in port he will update his contacts on our progress and attempt to encourage them to further their support for the fleet."
KMC_letters_of_marque:0 "Letters of Marque"
KMC_letters_of_marque_desc:0 "We have received tacit approval from the Americans to continue our operations, so long as they don’t impede on any of their interests. While the issue of piracy is relatively cut and dry, smuggling proves more of a thorny issue. Despite being a huge boon for us it is a relatively small nuisance for the Americans, and all being well we will be gone within a few years, so it is our hope that we will be able to continue our operations in America. Maybe a few Japanese luxuries handed to the right agents will be enough to sweeten the deal."
KMC_poke_the_kraken:0 "Poke the Kraken"
KMC_poke_the_kraken_desc:0 "One of the American’s conditions of their cooperation with us is that we step up our raids against Japanese shipping. While this is incredibly dangerous, they have offered to share intelligence on potential lucrative, lightly defended targets. We would get to keep any of the profits of these raids, of course. They seem content enough with the prospect of Japanese shipping being interrupted."

KMC_pirates_in_the_carribbean_desc:0 "The Americans have agreed that our warships will be able to pass through the Panama canal, although this is not the full agreement we need this bypasses the largest hurdle to our operation with the potential distance we must travel being massively reduced. "
KMC_a_route_secured:0 "The Route Secured"
KMC_a_route_secured_desc:0 "Finally the Americans have offered us conditions to allow us to dock in their ports. Once we dock in our first American port, we will sail officially as American ships. This bypasses the issue of the American’s needing to recognise our state and giving them an excuse for why they would allow ‘pirates’ into their ports. While this will undoubtedly be unpopular with some of our more ideological officers, they can’t deny the fact that this secures one of the potentially most dangerous parts of the journey. Once we pass Iceland we will be well within the range of German bombers, and seeing Russian warships flying under their own flag would present an easy target. Under the American flag, we will force the Germans to think twice."
KMC_lets_go_home:0 "Operation Ithaca"
KMC_lets_go_home_desc:0 "It is time. Over two decades since our struggles began, it is finally time to reassert ourselves as a real navy again. In this operation we will make it home and rejoin the fight or the last remnant of the Red Fleet will shatter, either way, it is time to put the shame of piracy behind us. All we can hope is that everything we have done, all the things that lead us to this moment have been worth it."

kmcgp.1.t:0 "Shchedrin's Grand Plan"
kmcgp.1.d:0 "Grigory Shchedrin stood in front of Yumashev sat at his desk “In the last days of the war against the Germans, a plan was being prepared in which a small detachment of submarines would sail from the Pacific Fleet to Arkhangelsk to try to do what they could to tilt the war in our favour, as I’m sure you remember” “I do” answered Yumashev inquisitively. “Obviously, it never came to fruition with the loss of Arkhangelsk and shortly after the union, but as far as I know the Front reclaimed Arkhangelsk in the West Russian War and ...” “Grigory, no” Yumashev interrupted as he slouched back in his chair. He had hoped he was going to be presented with a serious way out of the Fleet’s troubles, but instead, he was going to get, he anticipated a far fetched, unworkable and unproductive plan.\n\n “You aren’t going to suggest we should sail to Arkhangelsk? How will that solve anything? Their port freezes worse than ours, from what few reports we hear they are bombed to hell, if they are even still there, our ships can barely make it across the pacific if they can even make it out of the harbour...” “Yes, but” Shchedrin tried to interject. “...Most of our men have more loyalty to plunder than the old union and if we are going to get there we either need to make it through a sheet of literal fucking ice or through Japanese or American controlled waters, who I don’t need to remind you we have spent the best part of 20 years antagonising.”\n\nShchedrin paused for a moment. “Then what was all of this for, sir? We followed you every step of the way, when the union collapsed we stayed in Vladivostok, when the Presidium collapsed we followed you here, we have all done things that will trouble us forever, all to protect the fleet. If we stay here the fleet will slowly fall apart, the old guard will die and that will be the end. Everything we did for nothing. We could wait for Yagoda and his thugs to reassert themselves, but how long do we have? Even after all this time we are sailors of the Red Fleet, we find engagements, fight them, and win. Put everything we have into one final effort, one push to return home, to the only other group in the union that kept fighting. We succeed or we fail, but at least take action.”"
kmcgp.1.a:0 "“Bring me your plans, dismissed.”"
kmcgp.2.t:0 "The Shadow of a Fleet"
kmcgp.2.d:0 "Ivan Yumasehv stood on the docks, the cold wind biting at his nose as his hands were shoved deep in his pockets. One of the smaller ships, a converted fishing vessel, was coming back into port after being sent out to raid passing ships. Docking next to the ageing Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya it was dwarfed by the battleship’s size. Ropes were thrown over the side, and she was secured by the dockhands and the gangplank was lowered. The dishevelled Captain, a veteran who had been with the Fleet since the collapse of the Union began to descend. “No luck, Grigorovich?” asked Yumashev, picking up the mood. “No sir” as he beckoned towards a truck parked up behind Yumashev, the doors opened and two men began running towards the ship, a third following behind with a stretcher. “Mercenaries. Appeared just as we were preparing to board, Kalganov took a bullet to the throat.” \n\nYumashev winced, another man gone. Kalganov had been with the Fleet since the war, and where other men had left to find their own fortunes, deciding it was better to keep their plunder for themselves rather than share with the Fleet, Kalganov had stuck with him. This entire endeavour was to protect men like him, men who still believed in the traditions of the Red Navy, that its legacy was worth saving. This is where it had led him, being carried off a fishing boat under the shadow of a rusting fleet, in the far corner of the world, having died a thief. He deserved better than that. \n\nYumashev took his eyes off the stretcher being carried past him to notice Grigorovich’s eyes staring at him intently, only to flicker away as they met his gaze."
kmcgp.2.a:0 "Something has to change."
kmcgp.3.t:0 "Oil Tanker"
kmcgp.3.d:0 "One of our crews have returned with a large oil tanker, after being led back to our port and being relieved of its cargo it has been let back out to sea. This oil will be invaluable in keeping our fleet afloat, and will allow us to continue our operations for the foreseeable future."

kmcgp.3.b:0 "Keep it in our stores."
kmcgp.4.t:0 "Weapons Shipment"
kmcgp.4.d:0 "We have recently looted a shipment of weapons from a passing cargo ship. For such a deadly cargo the ship was relatively lightly defended, despite the resistance the mercenaries aboard were preparing to put up, they quickly stood down once our destroyer had fired a few salvos uncomfortably close to the ship's hull. With the mercenaries putting down their weapons and our crew safely aboard we commandeered as many crates as we could transport and let the ship on its way with a considerably lighter load."
kmcgp.4.a:0 "Success!"
kmcgp.5.t:0 "Cargo Freighter"
kmcgp.5.d:0 "One of our crews have returned with a large quantity of goods taken from a passing cargo ship. The goods, including clothes, cigarettes, alcohol, food and electronics are being transported to our stores presently for distribution, however, a large selection has already been taken aside by the victorious crew for personal use. This haul is sure to lift the spirits of the men, that is unless we choose to sell them on the black market for more 'useful' items."
kmcgp.5.a:0 "Success!"
kmcgp.6.t:0 "§RFailure!§!"
kmcgp.6.d:0 "The ship we dispatched to search for raiding targets returned empty-handed. The Captain and crew have offered several excuses, but all that matters is they have failed their mission.

kmcgp.7.t:0 "American Cargo Freighter"
kmcgp.7.d:0 "One of our ships has returned to port having just raided a cargo vessel heading from the direction of America.

This haul will be a huge boon to the Fleet."
kmcgp.7.a:0 "Success!"
kmcgp.9.t:0 "American Weapons Shipment"
kmcgp.9.d:0 "A ship flying the US flag was spotted entering the sea of Okhotsk, and, as we expected, it was heading for the port of Magadan full of US weapons to prop up their fascist puppet. While in the open Pacific, under the protection of the US fleet such a raid would be suicide, however, being situated so close to Japanese waters, and with the need to maintain plausible deniability surrounding their support for Magadan, the ship remained largely undefended aside from a small, but heavily armed contingent of mercenaries. Despite having received small arms fire, and several rockets from shoulder-fired Anti-Tank weapons, resistance soon subsided when a second submarine emerged from the water, radioing a warning that should resistance continue the ship would be torpedoed. It seems the captain understood it was better to sacrifice a small part of his shipment for the sake of his vessel. A sentiment we wholeheartedly agree with."
kmcgp.9.a:0 "Success!"
kmcgp.10.t:0 "American Oil Tanker"
kmcgp.10.d:0 "We have captured a large American Oil tanker in the Sea of Okhotsk. While it was flying the American flag and registered to an American company, judging from the resistance the ship put up, giving us ceaseless small arms fire and firing water cannons at our boarding party, we had expected the ship to have a significant mercenary contingent. Once a second and third boarding party had snuck up the starboard side of the ship, and cleared the deck, causing a number of casualties, we did not find the mercenaries we expected but a largely Russian crew. It appears they had been hired as cheap workers for Americans, but this voyage alone would pay more than most Russians will earn in a year, leading to their determined resistance. Unfortunately for those that survived, they will likely earn nothing as their cargo is now on its way to our ports. They expected riches, but their capitalist masters would have reaped the real profit, and a number of them lie dead in defence of the crumbs they would have been tossed. Having liberated the real prize from the capitalist this black gold will be shared among our hungry fleet."

kmcgp.10.b:0 "Keep it in our stores."
kmcgp.11.t:0 "Japanese Cargo Freighter"
kmcgp.11.d:0 "One of our ships has returned with a valuable haul! Japanese goods! Clothes, some exotic food, a number of items of jewellery, and some interesting, new electronics. The crew will be given their cut then the rest will be sold on. "
kmcgp.11.a:0 "Success!"
kmcgp.12.t:0 "Japanese Weapons Shipment"
kmcgp.12.d:0 "After raiding what we assumed to be a normal cargo vessel, it turns out to have actually been transporting a significant amount of Japanese made weaponry. The ship heading east away from the sphere has been of great confusion to us, but we have decided not to dig too deeply, and count ourselves lucky on our haul."
kmcgp.12.a:0 "Success!"
kmcgp.13.t:0 "Japanese Oil Tanker"
kmcgp.13.d:0 "After having intercepted a Chinese oil tanker shortly after leaving port in Manchuria they were escorted back to Kamchatka. The crew put up no fight whatsoever, and, after having taken what oil we required, made it known to us they would prefer to leave in the direction of America. In return for their generous contribution to our cause, we dealt with the problem of their belligerent Captain and sent them on their way."
kmcgp.13.a:0 "Transfer it to the Fleet immediately!"
kmcgp.13.b:0 "Keep it in our stores."

kmcgp.14.t:0 "Hold the Line"
kmcgp.14.d:0 "“I will authorise you to withdraw to the forests, but you will hold your positions!” Admiral Yumashev spoke down the receiver. “Yes, aerial support is on its w... Commodore...Commodore listen! You will be evacuated by sea from the pre-prepared positions. It is imperative you hold those positions at all costs, the hopes of everything we have worked towards rest on the courage and determination of your men... Of that, I have no doubt, Commodore. Good luck.” \n\n“We should send Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya, she would give those zealots a good pummelling.” suggested Admiral Kolesnik. “If they wanted to pick a fight with the fleet they should face the fleet.”\n\n“You’re right Kolesnik, I’ll send her under the command of Arkhipov. Yegorov!” A flustered orderly peeked his head into the room “Get Arkhipov here immediately.”\n\n“Yes comrade Admiral.” Replied the orderly before scurrying away. \n\n“We need to expedite our final preparations too, I don’t know how long the Naval Infantry will be able to hold against that mob.”"
kmcgp.14.a:0 "“Andreyev! Get me Shchedrin!”"
kmcgp.15.t:0 "A Gift from a Friend"
kmcgp.15.d:0 "Andrei ran a sawmill north of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. It was a small operation, mainly supplying the city itself and most of that business went to the Fleet, this of course did not stop the tax collectors from the Fleet coming every month. While Andrei had often tried to negotiate more favourable rates in return for his long time support it was to no avail. It was not so bad though, it at least meant a visit from Lieutenant Gulin. Yes, he came to collect the tax but he also brought with him plenty of treats that the Fleet had acquired from passing ships or their smuggling networks, or more specifically what Gulin’s associate had acquired, hidden from the fleet then passed it on to him to sell on, allowing them both to make a handsome profit.\n\n“Andrei! How are you? Good to see you, business is going well I hope?” Gulin inquired as he walked up to Andrei, sitting outside the mill.\n\n“I’m sure you do, got anything good for me to soften the blow?” responded Andrei dryly. \n\n“Ooh actually I do, just for you, I kept them aside.” he fumbled in the back of his truck and pulled out two bottles of Vodka. \n\n“Hmm, How much?” asked Andrei as Gulin began to walk towards him with a grin plastered across his face.\n\n“Oh, no” Gulin laughed “This is a gift, I thought you might like to celebrate your new baby boy I heard about last month, one for you, and one for him when he’s a bit older.”\n\nAndrei was taken aback “Oh, uhm thank you, Nikolai, are you sure? You don’t have to.”\n\n“Oh nonsense” As Gulin thrust the bottles into Andrei’s hands, “Things have been going well for me lately, what with my little business on the side. It pays to share the good fortune, especially which such a loyal patron of mine.”"
kmcgp.15.a:0 "Thank you, Nikolai."
kmcgp.16.t:0 "The Trial"
kmcgp.16.d:0 "Lieutenant Nikolai Gulin sat slumped in a chair before a desk, one eye was swollen, with dark bags under his eyes, clearly sleep-deprived. Before him, sat two officers and a commissar. The officer standing to the side of him, serving as the prosecutor continued “I’d like to call my next witness, Andrei Ignatyev.” Gulin’s heart sank, no more please. \n\n“Comrade Ignatyev, Do you swear to tell the truth before this tribunal, on pain of the Fleet’s Justice?” Asked the officer in the centre of the table. \n\n“I do.” said Andrei flatly. \n\n“The prosecution may continue.”\n\nThe prosecuting officer turned to Andrei “Comrade Ignatyev, do you recognise Lieutenant Nikolai Gulin in this room?”, Andrei slowly nodded. “Verbally please Comrade Ignatyev.” demanded the prosecutor. \n\n“I do.” responded Andrei. \n\n“Please read out the sworn statement you have presented to the court Comrade Ignatyev.”\n\nAndrei slowly pulled out a small piece of paper and began. “Over the course of a number of years, Lieutenant Nikolai Gulin passed on to me and sold for profit a large number of goods stolen from the Fleet. All of these items I still have I have surrendered to the fleet in hope of clemency.”\n\n“Have such items been surrendered?” Asked the officer in the centre.\n\n“Yes sir” responded the prosecutor as he gestured to a table on the left “As you can see here sir there are a number of items presented as evidence.” The table included, a watch, a set of cutlery, a number of plates and a single bottle of vodka.\n\n“Very good.” said the officer in the centre. I think that’s enough, Comrade Ignatyev you may leave. Ignatyev turned around to leave trying to avoid the gaze of Gulin. It didn’t matter, Gulin was only staring blankly into the middle distance. “Comrade Gulin, on all charges presented before the court you are found guilty. Because of the length of time you perpetuated these crimes, and the considerable financial rewards you personally received at the expense of the Fleet I see fit it to hand down the maximum sentence, which is death by firing squad to be carried out immediately.”"
kmcgp.16.a:0 "The gavel fell and Gulin was led outside."
kmcgp.17.t:0 "The Price of Loyalty"
kmcgp.17.d:0 "The last crate was loaded back on board the small boat Captain Grigorovich conducted his raids from. Finally, they had found some success. The Chinese vessel they had raided had been taken completely by surprise by the dawn raid and handed over a portion of their cargo without a fight. “Good job lads, you have done the fleet proud today, Kozlov, take us home.” \n\nKozlov stood deadly still. “Why should we go back? To surrender our hard-won plunder to the fleet so we’ll only be sent out again to die like Kalganov? We have been talking sir, we think it would be best to head further up the coast, they say that is where Captain Savitsky went to with his crew, he has connections and will let us keep all the profits.” \n\nGrigorovich paused, this sounded a lot like mutiny. He rested his hand on his pistol and responded sternly “Kozlov, enough of this talk, take us home and I’ll see to it you all get the share you are due.” \n\nKoszlov didn’t move “WE earned this sir, not Yumashev! Why should they get a cut of our work when they sit back on land doing nothing?”\n\n“You are a sailor in the Red Navy, Kozlov, you do your duty to serve the fleet and the nation, take us home.” Grigorovich grew tense, he could feel his hand begin to shake resting on his holster. \n\nKozlov spat, “Fat pigs living off our efforts. Good men like Kalganov die and Yumashev wastes it on keeping ships afloat that should have been scuttled years ago.”\n\nGrigorovich had heard enough, unholstering his gun and aiming it towards Kozlov he turned to the sailor on his right and began “Sidorv, take Kozlov to the hold he make...” Grigorovich’s eyes widened, as he realised too late what was happening. Sidorov fired. Grigorovich slumped to the ground. Not long after his body was unceremoniously dumped overboard, as the ship turned for the North."
kmcgp.17.a:0 "We are losing control."
kmcgp.18.t:0 "A Toast"
kmcgp.18.d:0 "Captain Ivan Maslennikov and Admiral Grigory Shchedrin sat in a dim office sharing a bottle of vodka. There was little else to do out here and either way both men felt in no mood to do anything else. “It’s going to shit, Grigory” Maslennikov swirled around his glass and looked up “Yumashev is losing it, Grigorovich isn’t coming back”. Shchedrin gave a slow nod, eyes fixed only on the table in front of him. Maslennikov continued “I said this would happen, of course abandoning communism led to this, there is no goal, no drive, the men have nothing to strive for except their own survival. Without discipline they will turn more desperate all the while corrupt crypto-capitalist officers exploit their fear for profit.” \n\nShchedrin squinted, while Maslennikov might be a little overzealous, he did have a point. The men were told ‘Do it for the fleet’ but unless you had been here from the beginning that meant very little, even the old guard was beginning to lose faith. All they saw was their own desperate situation, the occasional haul after a successful raid, then what appeared to be their ticket out of here taken away from them in order to preserve some nebulous idea and rusting ships.\n\nSomething would have to be done, Shchedrin knew. Beyond installing discipline, beyond cracking down on corruption and rouge crews conducting piracy of their own accord. The Fleet needed it’s soul back, it needed a purpose. If it was going to continue to exist, it needed to justify its own existence. Anyone desperate enough with a few friends and a boat can be a pirate, we have to aspire to be more. Shchedrin raised his glass “To the Indomitable Soviet people.” Maslennikov’s eyes lit up, in turn he raised his."
kmcgp.18.a:0 "“To the indomitable Soviet people.”"
kmcgp.19.t:0 "Ships on the Horizon"
kmcgp.19.d:0 "John Matthews, captain of the Penelope had a bad feeling about this voyage since it had barely left Portland. He had, against his better judgement, allowed a missionary to board the ship, the boy claiming that he wanted to spread the Lord's good word to the desperate souls of Russia. Although he had introduced himself as Isaac, glancing at an open passport it turned out the boy's name was Jonah, he had clearly hidden it after being refused to board other ships. The budding preacher obviously quickly caught on he had a particularly unlucky combination of name and chosen vocation, especially for one hoping to make it across the sea. The red morning sun had sealed it, and at around 11:34am a ship was spotted on the horizon that seemed to be waiting for the Penelope to come closer. Every time she changed course the ship in the distance had followed. As the ship came into better view Matthews could make out the shape of a small destroyer, though an old one, one that must be from the last war. It couldn't be the Japanese, not only did they rarely use ships that old they would generally leave American ships alone unless they strayed too close to their waters. No point in starting a diplomatic incident over a small cargo shipment.\n\nMaybe it was Mexican or Canadian? But they were nearly in Russia, no way they would be this far out. Could it be Chinese? Did they even have a navy? It certainly couldn't be Russian, he had been to Magadan before and never seen anything other than American cargo ships or ramshackle Russian fishing boats. But the mystery destroyer came ever closer, whoever it was they seemed intent on boarding him. Matthews radioed his men to get to the safe room, he would stay on the bridge and await whoever it was and prayed whatever was in store for him in this next encounter would be uneventful."
kmcgp.19.a:0 "Who are they?"
kmcgp.20.t:0 "Change in Tactics"
kmcgp.20.d:0 "As the destroyer came closer into view he could see the ensign it was flying. Although he didn't recognise it, the red star and hammer and sickle suggested it was Soviet. But they had collapsed years ago, and from what he had gathered in Magadan, the old Soviet remnant in the area had been pushed back to Irkutsk far inland. Nonetheless, a smaller boat had been dispatched and was heading towards the ship as the destroyer matched pace beside him. Looking across to the bridge through his binoculars he could see a bearded man in what looked to be a naval uniform looking back at him in exactly the same manner. The men must be aboard the boat now, he hid down behind the control panel in the bridge. The door was locked, hopefully, they would leave him be and do whatever they needed to do on the ship and leave.\n\nThere was a knock on the bridge door, he peeked his head up above the panel and caught the eyes of the man knocking, who...smiled? Another knock, and a muffled "hello" in a thick Russian accent. Warily he made his way to the door, through the window, the man who he assumed was an officer had stood back and was holding a clipboard under his arm, flanked by two sailors, each with a submachine gun. As Matthews opened the door, the officer still smiling began in broken English "Hello sir, my name Lieutenant Mikhail Yakhontov, Soviet Navy. I here to check documents." Matthews was in part relieved at the amicable nature of the man, but equally confused. Documents? Soviet Navy? He was heading to the Free State of Magadan, the Soviet Union hadn't existed in decades. He showed the man what documents he had, but the man gave a practised sigh. Matthews was pretty certain he hadn't even read them and doubted if he even could have had he actually wanted to. "I sorry sir, you fail to fill in proper import document. Part of cargo must be seized for payment of import tax." Import tax?! Proper doc...oh. These were pirates, polite, well-armed pirates hiding behind a facade of bureaucracy."

kmcgp.21.d:0 "Captain Yevgeny Ivanov left Christine’s house to go meet up with the men aboard his ship in the docks. Although odd to see Russians in America there was a small expat community out here in Alaska so his presence didn’t raise too many eyebrows. Just as long as nobody knew the precise nature of his dealings he would be fine, concerning both what he planned to leave with on his ship and his relationship with Christine. This optimism, unfortunately for Yevgeny did not last long. He turned the corner to be faced with four men, all in suits with pistols drawn. Instinctively he went to reach for his, but quickly thought better of it as he raised his hands above his head. “Yevgeny Ivanov, you are under arrest. You’re coming with us Russkie.” one of the men said as he took his pistol and cuffed his arms behind his back, and pushed him headfirst into the back of one of their cars.\n\nWhile Yevgeny was half tempted to unleash a tirade of verbal assaults against both the men and their mothers, and equally as tempted to protest his innocence he knew it would be futile and instead decided to remain silent. It was what he was instructed to do, he just hoped his men would realise something was wrong and leave without him. “Seems like it’s got a nice little business you’ve got going on doesn’t it, Yev?” said one of the men turning around from the passenger seat. It was now Yevgeny realised these were not normal police officers, wait, was this even the police or some other smuggling gang he had got on the wrong side of. How did they know his name? The man continued. “How about we come to an arrangement to make sure it stays that way?” "

kmcgp.22.d:0 "The man laughed for a brief moment, then became deathly silent, staring straight at Yevgeny for a few uncomfortable seconds. “You are part of an organisation actively working against the United States, we are aware of your connections and who you work for, in representing a group who engages in the interdiction of US shipping and the capture and ransom of American citizens and goods, you are considered an enemy of the United States of America.” Yevgeny’s lips began to dry as the man continued speaking “Your associate, Christine Butler, we are aware knows of your activities, in continuing to harbour and offer shelter to an enemy of the United States will face charges of treason, potentially facing the death sentence.” Yevgeny began to feel faint, but the man kept talking, clearly noticing he had shaken him enough “Unless that is, we can come to a deal.” \n\nYevgeny faintly nodded his head. The man began again “Keep making these trips, your activities here are a nuisance but ultimately unimportant. When you arrive in port you will rendezvous with our contact, to whom you will provide information about the nature of your operation, its capabilities, equipment stockpiles, personnel levels, your methods and importantly, any information you have detailing past and future raiding targets. We are sure you will make a reliable ally, that is unless you want Miss Butler to suffer the consequences of your actions.”\n\nThis was not at all how it was supposed to go, Yevgeny felt sick. He had no choice but to accept, weakly he let out “Ok.” \n\nWith that the car stopped, almost exactly where he had been picked up. “Thank you, Mr Ivanov, I’m sure you will have a long and prosperous relationship with the Agency. Safe travels.” He trudged back to his ship, his sense of freedom and dignity shattered within the space of less than 10 minutes."

kmcgp.23.t:0 "Three Men in a Boat"
kmcgp.23.d:0 "Kamak was in command of a tiny fishing vessel carrying a small shipment of weapons towards a remote village in the North of Manchuria to sell to a local partisan organisation. His crew consisted of two other Koryaks, natives of the northern Kamchatka peninsula who had offered their services to the Fleet in hope of finding any life other than the one of crushing poverty that they had always known. Where he had expected, or more appropriately been promised a life of adventure and opportunity he had found nothing of the sort. Instead he faced near total ostracisation from his supposed comrades, always assigned menial tasks and unfavourable postings. When he had been selected for an actual mission he had been overjoyed, finally expecting an opportunity to prove his worth and dedication to the Fleet that had so far given him nothing. He had sucked it in when he was told he would take this mission because he would “blend right in with the Manchurians or whoever the fuck those partisans actually are”, but seeing the run-down fishing vessel, and the 2 boys, barely even 16, beaming with the same enthusiasm he had at their age hurt him far more. \n\nIt was only their terrified expressions he could watch as the Japanese destroyer emerged out of the fog, blasting it’s horn and sounding it’s alarm as it bared down on them. A voice was sounding out over the loudspeaker in Japanese, but he had no idea what was being said. After the first few shots from small arms at the side of the boat, he desperately tried to turn around back to the direction he came from but it seemed of no use, the shots kept coming. That was until a round from the destroyer's main canon obliterated the small wooden boat."

kmcgp.24.d:0 "“I’ve been looking over your proposals Vice-Admiral Shchedrin, while your restructuring and anti-corruption proposals have a great deal of merit, we are already seeing some nascent signs of good news, your proposal to rejoin with the Front is still problematic, it relies on an awful lot of good fortune coming our way.” Yumashev shuffled the papers on his desk, awaiting Shchedrin’s response. \n\n“Of course comrade Admiral, but that is the key to all the other reforms, without a way to leave we will inevitably resort back to our old ways, we simply have no way of maintaining a full readiness, professional navy on a permanent basis with the resources at our disposal, I’m sure you have a number of reports from Admiral Spirodonov attesting to that fact” Shchedrin responded.\n\n“If we promise this and can’t deliver, that will be the end of us Grigory.” Yumashev thought for a moment “It is no use hoping for an opportunity to fall into our laps, I will draw up orders to cease the targeting of American shipping, there is no chance receiving their aid while we continue hostile operations against them.”\n\n“Perhaps we could implement some small scale political reforms to show we are worth doing business with.” \n\nYumashev scoffed “Do you think the Americans actually care who they are dealing with, they fund those bastards in Magadan, I don’t think any coddling of the natives is going to win us any favours.”\n\n“It’s worth a try.” sighed Shchedrin “It doesn’t have to be anything serious, just something to show our goodwill, and we need to make up an awful lot of goodwill.”"
kmcgp.24.a:0 "A journey starts with a single step. "
kmcgp.25.t:0 "The Opportunity"
kmcgp.25.d:0 "Shchedrin was heading back into the warm after inspecting the Crew of the Rykov. Today was a particularly cold day all he wanted was to get back inside. Behind him, running after him was Captain Yevgeny Ivanov, “Comrade Admiral.” Shchedrin turned to Ivanov, who he knew as a particularly effective smuggler, the only Captain in the fleet who had not had a single shipment seized. “I’m sorry to bother you sir” he panted as he offered a quick salute “But I might be able to assist, you put out a request for anyone who might be able to find a connection to the Americans.”\n\n“Ah of course Ivanov, your routes often take you to Alaska?” Shchedrin remembered. \n\n“Yes sir, and...” Yevgeny paused for a moment, wondering if the words he was going to say would be his last as a free man “I think I can get in touch with the CIA.”\n\nShchedrin stopped in his tracks, looking directly at Ivanov. If he were a suspicious man he might have considered the possibility that this connection may have had something to do with Ivanov’s impeccable smuggling record, he may have considered it had something to do with the spate of failed raids against American ships of late, but he decided he was not a suspicious man."
kmcgp.25.a:0 "“Follow me Ivanov, I’ll explain what I need you to do.”"
kmcgp.26.t:0 "The Terms"
kmcgp.26.d:0 "Ivan Yumashev, Girogry Shchedrin and Emil Spiridonov were all standing on the dock awaiting the return of Yevgeny Ivanov. As his ship, the Schastlivchik moored up, Ivanov bound down the gangplank. “Well, here are the terms. We are to continue our policy of non-aggression against the American’s and all their allied states, but we are to drastically increase our raids against the Japanese and they will under no circumstances recognise us as a legitimate state.”\n\nYumashev thought for a moment, “That’s it, anything else?”\n\n“They said they would be happy to share intelligence on potential high value targets, but other than that no sir.”\n\nYumashev sighed, “Well we are going to have to take their offer, it’s not like we have much choice, did they give any indication about allowing our passage through the Panama Canal, or allowing us to dock in their ports?”\n\n“I’m afraid not sir, they made me wait two days before responding with just those terms, they said any future deal is dependent on a display of our sincerity.”\n\n“They’re just using us.” interjected Spiridonov. “Why should we put our men at risk just to appease the Americans?”"
kmcgp.26.a:0 "Because there is no other choice."
kmcgp.27.t:0 "American Ships"
kmcgp.27.d:0 "Ivan Maslennikov burst into Shchedrin’s office in a fit of rage. “American flags?! Have you lost your mind Grigory! We are handing our ships over to the Capitalists! You’re going to put a little fucking American flag on the Bukharin, on the Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya?!”\n\n“Maslennikov, calm down!” Shchedrin decided it was best to try not to pull rank, he didn’t want a legal ruling of if a Vice-Admiral outranked the Chief Political Officer. “We are not handing the ships over to the Americans just registering them in America as a technicality. If we classify ourselves as American shipping we are protected from any potential German bombers. Do you think the Germans are going to let the resurgent Soviet Navy sail right past their puppet in Norway and do nothing about it if we don’t have America behind us?”\n\n“Then have the American’s show their worth and escort us! Do you think the Germans are so stupid to think that a fucking battleship is an American cargo ship? Maybe it’ll be captained by Popeye and we’ll be delivering a boatload of fucking SPINACH!” Maslennikov was now red in the face.\n\nShchedrin paused for a moment, he not quite sure what Maslennikov meant but caught the gist, “It’s just about plausible deniability, the Germans have to respond to American ships so far into their waters, with this plan they can protest, the Americans can deny there is anything going on, everyone has puffed out their chest and the world goes on. Besides, the state Germany is in right now they can barely issue more than a token objection.”\n\n“THEN WHY DO WE NEED THE...this is pointless, Yumashev will listen.” And with that Maslennikov left the room."
kmcgp.27.a:0 "Good luck Ivan."
kmcgp.28.t:0 "To Serve the Fleet"
kmcgp.28.d:0 "Ivan Maslennikov stood in front of the first cohort of Fleet Political Officers, or as he preferred to call them, Naval Commissars. “You have been chosen from amongst the most loyal and dedicated officers from across the entire fleet. You will be the bulwark against the fascist and capitalist influence that has infiltrated our navy, perpetuating it’s decadent and robber nature in the minds of our good soviet men. You are to wipe out this influence wherever it rears its head, and show no mercy to those who would enrich themselves at the expense of their comrades.”\n\nHe walked down the line and inspected each man in turn, his uniform, his posture, the determination in his eyes. This was what a real navy looked like. These men will lead by example and bring back the glory of the Red Fleet. They will drag every man, from the lowest sailor to Admiral Yumashev himself if need be kicking and screaming back to the standards we expect."
kmcgp.28.a:0 "Glorious."
kmcgp.29.t:0 "The Right Man for the Job"
kmcgp.29.d:0 "“Commodore Arkhipov” announced Yumashev. Vasily Arkhipov stood proudly in front of the desk of Admiral Yumashev. “You have distinguished yourself in the past few months, you run a tight ship. Your command has continued to serve as an example for the rest of the fleet to follow.”\n\n“Thank you, Comrade Admiral." responded Arkhipov, holding back a smirk. \n\n“As a result you have been chosen to lead the assault on the last significant pirate stronghold in the area, what we believe to be the remainder of the Mutineer Captain Savitsky’s men operating out of Ust’kamchatryba. While we don’t expect them to be heavily armed you will make a display of overwhelming force to reassert ourselves as a power to be reckoned with. You will command the destroyers Ryanyy and Bukharin, sail up the coast to Ust’kamchatryba and commence a bombardment of any fortified positions you find. Naval Infantry will establish a beachhead and fight their way into Savitsky’s compound. Clear any resistance you find, if you can capture Savitsky alive. You will then proceed to establish a command in the region to pick off any stragglers that may have slipped away in the initial assault. Bring back any valuable materials you find that could be of benefit to the Fleet. Understood?”\n\nWith no delay Arkhipov responded, “Yes, Comrade Admiral”. "
kmcgp.29.a:0 "“Very good Commodore, begin your preparations.”"
kmcgp.30.t:0 "The Assault"
kmcgp.30.d:0 "At 6:30 am, just as the sun began to rise the bombardment began. After so many years of hit and run tactics, avoiding engagements, subterfuge and stealth it felt good to be aboard a ship firing everything she had at a real target. It is not something Arkhipov had ever known, having only joined the fleet at 16 in the dying days of the last war, all said he felt a little uneasy in command of such power, wondering what it must be like being on the receiving end of such a bombardment. Now was not the time to dwell on such thoughts though, he had been entrusted with his mission.\n\nHe picked up the receiver from the control panel in front of him. “Captain Seymenov, begin the assault as planned”. Shortly after he watched as the smaller landing boats propelled themselves forward from the destroyers, under the cover of the barrage and two Yak3 fighters circling overhead. Through his binoculars he watched as the naval infantry fanned out across the shoreline, firing as they moved forward, setting up machine gun positions and lobbing mortar shells as the barrage ended with the infantry on land. From this moment on he would trust in the command abilities of his officers, and the courage and training of his men as they slowly left view as they entered the village.\n\nSome time later, with the operation complete, he communicated back to Admiral Yumashev the result. Although he had been unable to capture Savitsky alive the operation had been a stunning success, scores of valuable equipment were seized and the holdout had been completely eradicated. Admiral Yumashev seemed to be overjoyed with the result as well."
kmcgp.30.a:0 "“Congratulations Counter-Admiral Arkhipov”"
kmcgp.31.t:0 "Operation Ithaca"
kmcgp.31.d:0 "Ivan Yumashev above stood over table, a map sprawled across it with the Fleet’s High Command standing around. “Comrades, this is Operation Ithaca, what we have spent the last two years preparing for. All we have done has led to this Operation. Every Ship that we have made ready for the voyage will leave the Port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, cross the Bering Sea and follow the West Coast of America south. After making a brief stop in San Diego we will continue south through the Panama Canal and head north along the Eastern Seaboard, stopping for our final time in Norfolk.” \n\n“Here is where the most dangerous leg of our journey begins, we will continue north past Canada and pass to the north of Iceland, entering the Norwegian Sea. Once we are past Iceland the area is much more heavily patrolled by the German Kriegsmarine. We don’t know their current operational status due to the ongoing civil war in Germany but we will still remain on high alert for the remainder of the voyage. American agents in the Front will notify them of our impending arrival, however this is where our lead ship will break from the main formation and speed ahead to give notice to the Front of our Imminent arrival.”"
kmcgp.31.a:0 "Then we will be home."
kmcgp.32.t:0 "Cast Off"
kmcgp.32.d:0 "Well here it was. Over the last few weeks everything that could be carried was being loaded onto the warships, and the few smuggling vessels deemed substantial enough to manage the journey. Inventories had been checked, each man had been accounted for and assigned his post and duties, charts had been assembled, courses plotted and all diplomatic arrangements made. They had the word of the Americans that the Front would be expecting them, but with all his efforts over the last two years leading to this moment, Yumashev had given little thought to the future. Shchedrin was right, this endeavour had certainly reformed the fleet, it now moved with purpose and with unity but was it worth it? Would these ageing ships even be of use to the Front, would the meagre supplies they were bringing be worth all of the extra mouths to feed? \n\nNow was not the time to dwell on these things. “Cast off.” Yumashev gave the order, and the fleet was underway. The sea would be his home again for the next three months, at last living like a proper sailor again. No more ordering raids from the safety of land, no more sending boys to die smuggling a few guns to some korean partisans. Again it began to nag at him, only just as he had dispelled the thought from his mind, was it worth it? Everything he had done was to protect the fleet and it’s sailors, so that one day we can rejoin the fight for Russia."
kmcgp.32.a:0 "Now that day is here. "
kmcgp.598.t:0 "The Great Stairway to Freedom"
kmcgp.598.desc:0 "Admiral Yumashev looked out from the bridge at the approaching landmass in front of his ships. Every sailor lined up on the decks of every ship, all of whom stood for attention, as the Soviet naval flag flew steady in the wind. By the time the first ship arrived at the Bridge of the Americas, the sailors looked on at the Panamanian and  American flags that flew over the control towers. As the sailors looked above the bridge, they noticed a small gathering of civilians, soldiers, and workers looking down at them in awe. By the time the fleet finally lined up in formation, and sailed beneath the bridge, the crowd of people had grown tremendously, all standing shoulder to shoulder alongside the piers and docks that littered the sea lane. It was as if the entirety of Panama City had come to witness this historic moment. \n\nThe ships passed through one at a time, each one following after the other. The American soldiers and sailors stationed on ships within the harbor came out to salute and cheer on the Russians as they passed through each lock. The exchanges that the sailors had brought a smile upon Yumashev's face. The sailors aboard each ship saluted every set of sailors and soldiers that cheered them on. Civilians that witnessed the ships passing through carried a mix of stumped, surprised, and solaced expressions visible on their faces. Yumashev's smile lasted until his ship finally sailed through the canal. \n\nBy the time the last ship was lowered back down, and exited the Atlantic Gate, the sailors aboard each ship were jubilant and ecstatic, celebrating that the halfway point of their journey had finally been met. Admiral Yumashev picked up the handset to the fleet radio and ordered all sailors to rest. \n\n"Men, our next stop is Norfolk, Virginia. We will be docked alongside the American Atlantic fleet. I expect all of you to be on your utmost best behavior. It will be our last stop before we make our way home.""

kmcgp.599.t:0 "Rust Buckets Among Titans"
kmcgp.599.desc:0 "The sailors of the Red Fleet once again found themselves standing at attention aboard the decks of all ships. This time, the fleet would hold port in Norfolk, Virginia before their final departure home. Awaiting them would be the 2nd Fleet of the American Navy, which fielded some of the most modern naval vessels in the world. The screams of naval jet fighters overhead made the sailors tense up momentarily. They were in awe as to how many planes flew above, to some it appeared that there were more planes flying around than clouds in the skies. Some of the naval fighters formed an escort pattern, trailing the fleet as they sailed for port. \n\nInside the bridge, the radioman began reporting signals that were coming from the American port authority, all of it being spoken in Russian. With a surprised look at Admiral Yumashev, the radio operator informs him "Sir, we've been hailed by the American port authority. They are asking us to identify ourselves, and they speak oddly good Russian." \n\nYumashev, calmly walking over to the radio man, takes the transmitter from his hands and simply nods at him. \n\n"This is Admiral Ivan Stepanovich Yumashev, of the Soviet Pacific Fleet speaking." He said proudly in polite Russian, "I appreciate your goodwill gesture of Russian, however, I learned some English while attending a few naval events with British colleagues. We can switch to that if you would prefer." \n\nThe sound of radio static was heard for a moment, as the receiver crackled back to life "Admiral Yumashev, this is Admiral James Greer speaking. I have been informed that you can speak English, is that correct?" The American over the line asked. \n\n"Yes, Admiral, can you understand me?" Yumashev says in a strangely thick Scottish accent. \n\nSurprised, the American responds. "Yes sir, you have a strange accent, but I hear you. You may proceed to port." \n\nAs the Soviet ships sailed into the harbor, they were met with an outstanding view of several American aircraft carriers docked up together, sailors aboard the decks of every ship. The Russians, as they approached the piers, saluted their American counterparts, and were met with the same steely-eyed salutes."

kmcgp.600.t:0 "A Reunion"
kmcgp.600.d:0 "It was with a sense of trepidation that Nikolai Kuznetsov watched the remains of the Pacific Fleet enter the port of Arkhangelsk. As the Admiral of the Front’s Fleet it fell to him to welcome the new ships, the only problem being he had no ships of his own to command so felt rather impotent in the face of these new arrivals. As the ships sailed past, sailors lined the decks saluting to the shoreline.\n\nHearing Alexandrov's band blasting out the Internationale on the shore, and the red flag fluttering from the masts of the arriving ships was certainly a powerful sight. These were men coming back to join the fight, he could not help but wonder what hardships they had endured out in the far east, if they were anything like the years of struggle and resistance that the Front had put up over the last 20 years. He would no doubt find out soon enough he wondered. All that mattered now was that the two arms of the Soviet Military were back together. The Fleet arrived, whether they knew it or not at a pivotal time in history, with the German bombings over the Front was once again on the march and this time there would be no failure. Order and Justice would be restored over Russia and retribution delivered to all those who had humiliated and exploited her people. Hand in hand the Red Army and Navy would drive out the robber hordes and thieving bandits.\n\nAt the top of the gangplank Admiral Yumashev appeared, a man Kuznetzov had not seen in a long time. After descending Yumashev offered a sharp salute, which was returned in kind by Kuznetsov, followed by a firm handshake then an embrace.\n\n“It is good to be home Nikolai.”"
