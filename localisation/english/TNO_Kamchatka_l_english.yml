 KMC_Ivan_Yumashev:0 "Ivan Yumashev"
 POLITICS_IVAN_YUMASHEV_DESC:0 "Admiral Ivan Stepanovich Yumashev has spent several decades in the Red Navy, even though the country he once sailed for no longer exists. The seas he has sailed span from the Baltic to the Okhotsk, but these days he mostly finds himself staring at the Bering. He spent the entirety of the Great Patriotic War commanding the Pacific Fleet, patrolling the waters and occasionally getting into skirmishes with Japanese vessels. He heard of the news of the Union's defeat when he was stationed in Vladivostok, and quickly sprang into action and removed the fleet from the harbor before the Japanese jackals could arrive.\n\nWhen the dust settled, Admiral Yumashev and his officers pledged their loyalty to the regime of Yagoda, who helped them find them a temporary job. As the reactionaries pushed forward, the navy forces of Yumashev had to find another home, far away from the besieged forts of Priamurye. The city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky had been abandoned by the Soviet government and most of its residents, and little infrastructure remained here aside from a few villages. The shores of Kamchatka became the Red Navy's landed headquarters, and the small fishing town was converted into a makeshift naval base.\n\nFar away from the civilization, the Far Eastern Red Navy has done nothing but chip ice off the sides of their ships, impotently watching as the region fell into chaos and infighting. Without any reasonable way to obtain supplies and fuel, the sailors started to earn their living through piracy and smuggling across the Pacific, becoming an additional obstacle for Japan and the US in their competition in the ocean. It can be said that Admiral Yumashev isn't fond of what his men were turned into - but it also can be assured that he will not deprive his men from their only viable way of living on the edge of the Earth."

 KMC_Power_Vacuum: "Power Vacuum"
 POLITICS_KMC_POWER_VACUUM_DESC:0 "The great fleet has sailed from its port for the final time. The imposing metal objects that once floated in the Kamchatka harbor are now on their way to Arkhangelsk. In their wake, the city, lacking leadership, has fallen into a state of anarchy. With much of the City’s population directly tied to the Navy, the absence of their presence has brought a very real sense of emptiness to the land, with the individuals remaining having no real authority figures available to provide direction. It appears as if this once great city will now be a jewel in another leader’s crown…"

 KMC_Emil_Spirodnov: "Emil Spiridonov"
 POLITICS_KMC_EMIL_SMIRNOV_DESC:0 "Emil Spridonov, born September 26, 1925, has had a life born out of necessity. Initially seeking a career in land management, the great patriotic war brought him to the Kiev Special Naval School. While attending a naval academy in Leningrad, the intensifying German siege caused a mass evacuation of the city. Spridonov, only seventeen at the time, was placed on a destroyer with other naval recruits to be evacuated to Arkanghelsk. Upon his arrival, Spridonov was given command over a Stalinets class submarine, a position mostly involving protecting the northern coast from the occasional German excursion. By 1945, the Soviets were on their last legs. With German forces moving further and further inland, an evacuation of the Soviet navy to the east was Authorized. Spridonov carried out this order alongside his fellow officers, sailing his submarine to the port of Kamchatka. Initially swearing their fealty to the Soviet successor state of Genrikh Yagoda, White Army revolts and a general collapse of authority led to Spridonov swearing his fealty to the breakaway state of Kamchatka, led by Admiral Ivan Yumashev. Due to his proficiency, Spridonov was able to secure a position in Yumashev’s inner circle, being tasked with deals with Soviet statelets and the wider world. This has included negotiations with the WRRF, deals with mercenaries, deals with the port of Magadan, and even a small amount of diplomacy with the United States. As the naval state sails into an uncertain future, Spridonov will be there until the end, as he is a man of service, born out of necessity. "
 KMC_Nikolay_Smirnov: "Nikolay Smirnov"
 POLITICS_KMC_NIKOLAY_SMIRNOV_DESC:0 "Nikolay Smirnov, born 22 September 1917, was born in a poor peasant family. Originally dedicating himself to an agricultural college, Smirnov enrolled in the navy in 1937 and began his climb of the ranks after graduating in 1939. Joining the Pacific Fleet, Smirnov was a humble submarine commander, engaging in skirmishes with the IJN, but largely was unknown until the collapse of the Soviet Union. With mass leadership vacuums in all army branches, Smirnov was one of the few competent Pacific Fleet commanders available. Promoted to Captain in 1947, the young Smirnov commanded the submarines of Admiral Ivan Yumashev’s fleet. In the mid 1950s, the situation in the Far-East was rapidly deteriorating, with Genrikh Yagoda no longer able to suppress white revolts and army mutinies. Smirnov, seeing this weakness, assisted Yumashev in seizing control of Kamchatka. Due to this loyalty, Smirnov was appointed to direct the finances of the Navy. This job, which although sounds prestigious, mostly just involves groveling for more funding from the WRRF and other friendly powers, as well as privateering operations. Although not a glamorous job, Smirnov, always a competent man, is happy to fulfill his duties to the navy and to the revolution."

 KMC_sailor_state: "Sailor State"
 KMC_sailor_state_desc: "While throughout history, military juntas have most often been dominated by the army, Kamchatka is quite the exception. A bastion of communism headed by the remnants of the Soviet Pacific Fleet and their admiral, Ivan Yumashev. A navy with a state is a peculiar idea, and while the larger, coastal settlements of Kamchatka remain mostly in order, the interior of the peninsula is in effective anarchy, as the Red Navy cannot venture inland, and is forced to sail on the high seas as pirates in order to sustain itself."
 KMC_raiders_of_the_north_sea: "Raiders of the Pacific"
 KMC_raiders_of_the_north_sea_desc: "With the mutineers defeated and Golovko's power safe for now, we can truly begin to put our fleet to use as a raiding fleet. Piracy may seem like something beneath our dignity as sailors, but it is profitable, and God only knows that anything of value is hard to find in this wasteland."
 KMC_red_navy: "Red Navy"
 KMC_red_navy_desc: "While the Red Navy has turned to piracy to make ends meet and simply survive in the ever-raging warlord era in Russia, they have not lost their pure, ideological commitment to communism and the principles of Marx, and Lenin, representing perhaps one of the last true bastions of Communist thought in Russia, and furthermore the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, occupied by fascists and liberals alike!"
 KMC_free_men_on_the_sea: "Free Men on the Sea"
 KMC_free_men_on_the_sea_desc: "Following the collapse of the Union, we lost our contact with the west, and thus, our flow of supplies, with that, the Red Navy lost much of its purpose, and while it is not easy to survive, the collapse of the Union gave Ivan Yumashev, and by extension the Red Navy near total liberty to do as they wish, including piracy..."
