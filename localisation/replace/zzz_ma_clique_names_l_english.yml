 ma_jiyuan_vision_desc:0 "A functioning government does not necessarily mean it is operating at peak efficiency, nor accounts for its sustainability or whether it truly delivers what was promised. Ma Jiyuan intends to change this veiled situation that many have chosen to ignore so long no people took the matters to the streets. Long have the Nationalist government react to changes usually months or even years after it was initially needed, creating more troubles for their successors, a pile of bureaucratic mess that only adds up.\n\nNo more. Ma shall take these matters into his own hands. And his allies for that matter. He will see some of the greatest reforms in the history of the Republic urgently needed by the regime in exile,\n\nAnd he has a plan..."

 POLITICS_LONG_YUN_TMM_DESC:0 "§YChairman of the Xinan Political Commission§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 27th November 1884 \nZhaotong, Yunnan Province§! \n\nYunnan is the birthplace of the modern Republic of China. Ever have the lands and their inhabitants waged wars and expeditions in the name of a Republican Revolution against those who yet hinges on backward autocratic regimes. Be it the Qing Dynasty or the Beiyang Government, the Grand Marshal or the Generalissimo, the Dian Clique has been long independent and rebellious, never truly submitting itself to the outsiders, until now.\n\nLong Yun is very much a patriot who only wishes to see China prosper. Following the legendary commander Cai E, Long Yun struck the enemies of the Revolution under the banners of the National Protection Army with great fervor and courage, as he did against the Common Enemy with Chiang, even he despised the latter. Under his rule, Yunnan grew prosperous, industrious, and stable compared to the chaotic frontier territorie. His regime actively constructed banks, factories, schools, and infrastructure, linking up the ancient Lands South of the Winds. And alongside them, a statue of Marshal Long in every point of interest.\n\nLong Yun feels his time is running short. Long had he dreamt of that momentous day when Wang Zhaoming contacted him for help. Harbouring hatred towards Chiang, Long Yun of that day did not know how his favour would reshape the history of China forever if it mattered in the end at all. For Long Yun though, thinking too much has been a great burden, adding to the existing ones, chief amongst the Defeat of 1947. Optimistically speaking, Long is yet another guardian god of the Southwest after his mentor Cai E. After he and Li Zongren successfully rid He Yingqin, Xinan is one of the most independent regions of the Sphere. Although every single inch of land here is supposedly controlled by Nanjing, the tentacles of the Japs and their traitor dogs can influence the mountainous south no longer.\n\nLong Yun sees the Three Provinces as the last vestiges of China. Even if Guangxi has been ever straying from his control and Guizhou in rebellion. Despite the crash of the Yunnanese economy following the failed reforms that doomed his homelands, and that his people fell destitute, surviving only with drug trades and human trafficking. Even when drawing his last few dozen breaths, from the windows of his palace he can still see the shining statues of the General Long Yun and of the Revolutionary Long Yun. And that comforts the mind of an ailing man."
 
 POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "§YChairman of the Xikang Province§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 10th January 1895 \nAnren, Dayi County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nOne can only guess if Liu Wenhui feels any fulfillment of his accomplishments, but one would certainly know his heart is filled with regret. Once a powerful warlord, Liu aimed to wield the full might of Sichuan and compete for the rule of China with Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ming as Liu Bei, a great leader with whom he bears the same surname, did. Nowadays, Liu feels disturbed by merely looking at the map. Long has he dreamed of publically humiliating He Guoguang and taking back Sichuan, and then dash for Nanjing to expel the Japanese bandits.\n\nThroughout the decades he'd spent in Xikang, Liu Wenhui felt he himself grew and learned just as the province did. He originally approached the Communists and intelligentsia to use them against the Kuomintang, but find himself eventually coming to an agreement with those men he previously disliked. He was especially moved by the scientific measures implemented to turn Xikang into a prospering province. Contemplating, Liu finds his policies back in Sichuan not only idiotic, but also contributed to his downfall.\n\nXikang's special status won't last forever. Liu knows this, and so are others. He felt the conflict between the Communists and Nationalists in Ya'an are just as intense as it is back in Qinghai. The politics of Xikang is no house, and he would be forced to make a choice between them, or to forge a path of his own, however unlikely that is.\n\nOne may think peace would be optimal for Liu, gathering strength in the dark, yet he finds it appalling. Growing up in the confusing Warlord Era, Liu sees opportunity only in ceaseless wars. Stagnation of the status quo would only render his projects ever more unlikely. He knows all but too well that he is no longer the same boy marching out of Dayi, and that all-commanding Chairman of Sichuan. If history refuses to give him another chance, he only wishes for a good image amongst the people of Xikang for decades to come."

 GUZ_Li_Pinxian_hog_desc:0 "§YLeader of the Guangxi Clique§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 22nd April 1890 \nCangwu County, Wuzhou, Guangxi Province§! \n\nLi Pinxian was never supposed to be anyone in the Gui Clique. A Hunnan warlord seeking refuge in Guangxi, he was first and foremost an outsider to the Liangguang. If it wasn't for Huang Qixiang's public criticism of Li Zongren's actions that led to his eventual downfall, he would be likely to remain as a general than a supreme leader, and yet here he is. Taking over the legacy of Li Zongren, Pinxian climbed all the way to the position of vice-chairman of the Xinan Political Commission. As the first Gui leader to visit Kunming since the feud between the factions, it is assumed that he would play the role of a negotiator, softening up with the Dian Clique and changing the Isolationism of Li Zongren. After all, since Long Yun's days are numbered, it could be helpful to Yunnan-Guangxi relations in the future, perhaps even allowing the two to regain their old strength and rival that of Nanjing. For now, though, these remain but rumours, rumours that are yet to be confirmed."

 GUZ_Yang_Ruxuan_for_desc:0 "§YThe Nanjing Liaison to the Xinan Political Commission§!\n--------------\n§YBorn ?th ? 1895 \nPangu, Pingchuan, Binchuan County, Yunnan Province§! \n\nWhen Yang Ruxuan returned to Kunming, he was no longer a follower of Zhu Peide. After the fall of Chongqing, seeing all hopes are lost, he is amongst the first batch of officers to surrender, and as a perk, were given extraordinary payment and status by the Japanese. Thus General Yang remained, staying in the General Staff of the Nanjing Regime. Since the Second Yun-Gui War, he has been dispatched by the Central Government to Kunming, taking part in the Japan-mediated peace talks, and was eventually left in Kunming to oversee many things here in the Southwest, as a liaison. In addition, he was also awarded many merely ceremonious roles, such as the Commandant of the Anti-Air forces. As it is part of his duty, he often excuses himself from the messy political scene and makes for the airports, where he spends hours each day, staring into the old landing strips, lost in thoughts."

 GUZ_Miao_Yuntai_eco_desc:0 "§YThe Miao Family§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 23rd March 1894 \nKunming, Yunnan Province§! \n\nA well-known industrialist, Miao Yuntai found the New Fudian Bank and for a long while had an almost complete monopoly of the Southwestern economy, even before he participated in the political scene. Years after Zhou Fohai purposely ruined his master project of transforming Yunnan, Miao Yuntai is now once more taking up the mantle of rejuvenating Yunnan and the entire Southwest. However, this time, rather than brilliant economic investments and austerities, Miao was forced to take a far more sinister path. Seeing Yunnan would otherwise fall into complete anarchy, Miao opted for more unconventional methods of acquiring funds and keeping the Three Provinces running. Since 1952, with the unofficial approval of Miao, the Yunnanese Army started production of opium, and its monopoly through rifles worked great to benefit the army and Miao Family. Now, Miao Yuntai has ascended to become the third most powerful player in the Southwest. What this 'Patriotic Capitalist' thinks of himself are not certain, but hatred towards him is well heard in every corner of the Southwest."

 GUZ_Lu_Han_sec_desc:0 "§YChief of the Dian Army§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 6th February 1896 \nZhaotong, Yunnan Province§! \n\nLu Han has always been one of the closest companions of Chairman Long Yun and has always been the Second-in-Charge of the New Dian Clique essentially since its birth. Since He was expelled, the military affairs of Yunnan are now his alone to bear. As an old friend of Long, he is well aware of Long's great anguish, seeing how Yunnan, the Southwest, and the whole of China have become. As he ages, Long, ever more dull and senile, chose to bar himself from daily routines, and have grown numb. Every day, while taking over some of Long's work, he would pass by Long Yun's garden en route to picking up documents to look over and sign. And there he would see the old Marshal Long, sitting on a simple bench beneath a statue of him. His eyes idle and his thoughts far, all while his son ceaselessly bombards him with plans after plans, all of which unsettling to Lu. Lu Han knows when the day comes, he will be as immovable as his friendship with Chairman Long.\n\nHe must save Yunnan, and Long Yun."

 XIK_Zhang_Zhihe_hog_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Department of Internal Affairs§!\n§RChinese Communist Party§! - §NLiu Shaoqi Leaning§!\n--------------\n§YBorn ?th August 1894, Linqiong, Qionglai County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nOriginally a Sichuan commander, Zhang Zhihe was one of the first Sichuanese to adhere to the Revolution promised by the Communist Party, and has since then remained as the most important radical left political figure in greater Sichuan. He was the representative chosen by Liu to formally proclaim allegiance to the National Revolution in Wuhan, the one who created the 24th, and the defender of Changsha. But out of all historical events he'd experienced, the time he spent in Yan'an with Comrade Mao left him most memories.\n\nAngered by Liu Wenhui's decision to expel the United Front, he left with the Communists for Golmud, but the intensifying factionalism eventually drove him back in 1954, with a renewed goal - To persuade Liu Wenhui to the side of the proletariat, and to continue the Revolution in Xikang and Sichuan. With western China falling into negligence and chaos, Xikang remained the only politically stable area, something Zhang Zhihe has been taking advantage of to further his objectives."

Too many good men died because of incompetent leadership and lack of good equipment. Amidst the mediocre military leadership of NRA, however, Xue Yue is one of the few to be feared even by the Japanese. Under his command, the 5th Military Region dealt uncountable casualties to the IJA in southern China, a feat that proved crucial to providing the Nationalist regime safe passage to Chongqing after the fall of Shanxi and the Communists in 1942-1943.\n\nAlthough a legendary figure, Xue Yue despised the politicking of the Republic he fought for, especially over the long-running despotism of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Ching-kuo, choosing to rather side with Liu Wenhui than endure the chaos in Qinghai. Building a pragmatic, united Kuomintang in Xikang, Xue Yue would rather see it entirely disbanded or renamed than to fall under the grasp of the Chiang dynasty once more."

Li Xianchun is critical in contributing to the developing economy of Xikang, his investments granted tens of thousands of jobs and foo security. However, his efforts would have been impossible, had Li not already possessed booming businesses in Sichuan too. Li Xianchun, alongside his brother Li Guangpu, are the masters of Ya'an and Chengdu, linking the two halves of Sichuan ever since the fall of Chongqing."

Although he has since left the political scene largely since 1954, Zhang took up the position of Director of the Department of Security, continuing his contribution to the stability of Xikang. Under Zhang's guidance, the Xikang government was checked by strong, auditory power he personally supervised, ridding Xikang of the plague of corruption that would have otherwise been disastrous to its infant economy. His manipulation of religious policies also won the support of many, a foundation upon which Liu's ambitious projects may be executed. After 1954, Zhang Weijiong sided with neither the Nationalists nor the Communists, instead of taking a nonpartisan position as an apolitical strongman that defends Xikang from evil within or without."

Unlike the regimes of Sheng Shicai and Shi Yousan, the Xinan Commission does not need Japan's aid at all. Rather, it is Xinan who has been trading vital resources to Guangdong ever since its creation. Tokyo and Nanjing barely care if it sends its tribute, nor who controls the army. From an outside perspective, compared to most other regimes, Long Yun's Xinan has always been playing the role of an Anti-Japanese China within the Japanophile Sinosphere, but few know what would become a Post-Long Yun Southwest."

 GUZ_legacy_of_dianbi_desc:0 "In 1948, Zhou Fohai gave the Fudian Bank mintage rights. However, on top of that, he also lent a significant amount of old fiat currency created by the Chongqing Central Bank to Fudian. In a false sense of security, the Fudian engaged in large-scale money lending, leading to a high rate of non-performing accounts.\n\nThis escalated when in 1950, Zhou Fohai, under the pretext of unifying currency, made a demand to Fudian to immediately pay back all old fiat currency loans in exchange for the newer fiat currency, the Fabi issued by the Nanjing Central Bank. Needless to say, this completely broke the flow of money, and the Fudian Bank almost instantaneously declared bankruptcy.\n\nAs both Tokyo and Nanjing refused to lend out any more money on a significant scale, the Dianbi, or the Yunnan currency quickly devalued into nothing but play money. Many reconstructions and investment projects halted, and the Southwestern economy crashed. Although Long Yun stabilised it eventually by extending mintage to powerful bankers and merchant families, the damage was done. Yunnan's economy is in shambles, and there is little chance this situation would be changed."

 GUZ_legacy_of_the_third_diangui_war_desc:0 "In 1951, immediately after He's expulsion, Long Yun was deeply offended by Li Zongren's idea of inviting the Central Bank into the Southwest. Li, on the other hand, was also angered by his fierce regionalism and radical anti-Japanese behavior. But the foremost factor that drove the two factions to all-out war is perhaps their long-standing feud. Initially, the Dian Army, well known for being a force to reckon with, defeated advancing columns of Li and was making a dash for Baise. However, Japan's sudden entrance into the scene forced the two parties into peace by promising more autonomy. After the war, the Southwest on the surface is dominated by the Dian Clique, yet Guangxi won relatively autonomy in its military and financial affairs also, starting the decade-long internal strife between the two powerful cliques, eager to win the Southwest for themselves."

To pay back debt as soon as possible without incurring huge interest, the Xinan regime was forced to resort to Opium cultivation, the production of which allowed Xinan to smoothly exit the monetary crisis, and helped pull its citizens out of poverty.\n\nAlthough strict policies in the Southwest prevented a humanitarian crisis of opium addiction (And that most Chinese, due to the Opium Wars, largely despised drug consumption), drugs nonetheless took over as a main source of income, as capitalists rush to these highlight valuable industries, abandoning others to eventual bankruptcy. Yunnan, who was hit the hardest, was the biggest offender, investing openly in drug production. As history enters the 1960s, Xinan is capable of producing many dozen types of drugs, including LSDs and Heroins, Southwestern made drugs are now sold worldwide, even more than the rice grains of China and electronics of Guangdong."

At the same time, Yang Sen, who is also exiled from his lands amidst Sichuanese civil wars also went into hiding with Guizhou alongside his ragtag 20th Army, forging an alliance with the nominal chairman of the province Wang Jialie, forming what is called the Tongzi Clique. And thus, the battle of the three armies ensued in Guizhou for decades, in one of the poorest, smallest, and least developed provinces of all China."

 GUZ_a_new_industry_desc:0 "The Southwest grew, but only a few tasted the fruits. Outside of major cities and towns, warlord infighting and breach of drug laws led to a significant decline of labour force in the rural areas, driving the peasantry in the Southwest into extreme poverty. And out of desperation, an industry arguably eviler than drug trafficking was born.\n\nHuman trafficking has been common, but not to the point of being widespread ever since the term China was coined. Although the central government back in the 1920s actively suppressed it, many villagers in the Southwest, now with nothing to sell, are now selling their daughters and spare women to the faraway central plains of China. Some families thought they were giving the female in question a better chance to live a decent life from rumours about Nanjing and its richness, but most had not the time to think about such things. Meanwhile, some trafficking groups, blacked by officials through bribes are also known to forcibly kidnap women and female students of the urban areas, who are sold at higher prices for being 'educated'. Terrorising the women of Kunming and Dali to the point that few if none dare to travel by themselves unless armed.\n\nUnder the watchful eyes of the statues of Long Yun, human trafficking is an organised, efficient and effective industry."

Industrialisation and electrification of Ya'an and Xichang followed quickly, and with physical wealth comes that of the mind.
