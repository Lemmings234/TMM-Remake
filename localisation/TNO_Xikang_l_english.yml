### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "Born in 1895, Liu Wenhui is a military man through and through, graduating from Baoding Military Academy in 1916. Returning to Sichuan from Baoding, Liu Wenhui originally joined Liu Cunroi's Sichuan clique, but later joined the Kuomintang in 1926. Quickly rising the ranks of the National Revolutionary Army, Liu was promoted to Commander of the NRA's 24th Army, and appointed governor of the entirety of Sichuan Province in 1929. Facing fierce competition from more than 5 other warlords, Sichuan Province was exceedingly unstable and a hotbed for conflict. Coalitions, counter coalitions, skirmishes and plotting defined his governorship of Sichuan as he struggled to maintain power. Eventually in 1934 he lost power to his nephew, Liu Xiang, and was kicked out of Sichuan and declared Governor of Xikang province instead. Liu's relationship with Chiang Kai-shek, much like the province of Sichuan itself, was unstable. Far away from the central government, Liu was able to repeatedly deny orders from Chiang.\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liu Wenhui was cautious and made sure his troops saw as little action as possible. When the Japanese arrived in Sichuan during their Go-Go offensive, Liu Wenhui, as the strongest remaining contender in Sichuan, rallied his men and retreated far into Xikang, setting up camp in the small city of Ya'an. Liu refused to surrender to Japanese, and the Japanese, seeing no importance in the small mountain province, decided not to follow him.\n\nNow more than a decade after Japan's offensive into Sichuan, Liu Wenhui sits isolated as one of the only remaining free warlords in China. His native homeland of Sichuan lies across the border, and while it may be under the direct control of the central government, Sichuan has once again been plunged into instability with many factions and partisans battling it out for control. While Liu himself would like to see a free China, he faces resistance from many of his subordinates who claim facing Japan would be suicide. It would truly take a miracle for Liu Wenhui to take up arms once more..."

 XIK_Zhang_Zhihe_hog_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Department of Internal Affairs§!\n§RChinese Communist Party§! - §NLiu Shaoqi Leaning§!\n--------------\n§YBorn ?th August 1894, Linqiong, Qionglai County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nOriginally a Sichuan commander, Zhang Zhihe was one of the first Sichuanese to adhere to the Revolution promised by the Communist Party, and has since then remained as the most important radical left political figure in greater Sichuan. He was the representative chosen by Liu to formally proclaim allegiance to the National Revolution in Wuhan, the one who created the 24th, and the defender of Changsha. But out of all historical events he'd experienced, the time he spent in Yan'an with Comrade Mao left him most memories.\n\nAngered by Liu Wenhui's decision to expel the United Front, he left with the Communists for Golmud, but the intensifying factionalism eventually drove him back in 1954, with a renewed goal - To persuade Liu Wenhui to the side of the proletariat, and to continue the Revolution in Xikang and Sichuan. With western China falling into negligence and chaos, Xikang remained the only politically stable area, something Zhang Zhihe has been taking advantage of to further his objectives."
 XIK_Xue_Yue_for_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Secretariat§!\n§BKuomintang§! - §YIndependent Xikang Conservatives§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 27th December 1896, Lechang County, Shaozhou Prefecture, Guangdong Province§! \n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War was one of humiliation and desperation. Too many good men died because of incompetent leadership and lack of good equipment. Amidst the mediocre military leadership of NRA, however, Xue Yue is one of the few to be feared even by the Japanese. Under his command, the 5th Military Region dealt uncountable casualties to the IJA in southern China, a feat that proved crucial to providing the Nationalist regime safe passage to Chongqing after the fall of Shanxi and the Communists in 1942-1943.\n\nAlthough a legendary figure, Xue Yue despised the politicking of the Republic he fought for, especially over the long-running despotism of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Ching-kuo, choosing to rather side with Liu Wenhui than endure the chaos in Qinghai. Building a pragmatic, united Kuomintang in Xikang, Xue Yue would rather see it entirely disbanded or renamed than to fall under the grasp of the Chiang dynasty once more."
 XIK_Li_Xianchun_eco_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Department of Financial Affairs§!\n§BKuomintang§! - §gUnited Front§!\n--------------\n§YBorn ?th ? 1886, Anren, Dayi County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nOther than serving the government, Li Xianchun is also the chief executive officer of the Kangyu Corporation, the largest financial conglomerate in Xikang, and the chief director of the Xikang Provincial Bank, cementing his position as the financial Godfather of millions. Li Xianchun is critical in contributing to the developing economy of Xikang, his investments granted tens of thousands of jobs and foo security. However, his efforts would have been impossible, had Li not already possessed booming businesses in Sichuan too. Li Xianchun, alongside his brother Li Guangpu, are the masters of Ya'an and Chengdu, linking the two halves of Sichuan ever since the fall of Chongqing."
 XIK_Zhang_Weijiong_sec_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Department of Security§!\n§NNonpartisan§!\n--------------\n§YBorn ?th August 1888, Dechang County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nBefore Zhang Zhihe and Xue Yue's arrival, Zhang Weijiong has always acted as the sole leader of the civilian government besides Liu Wenhui himself. Although he has since left the political scene largely since 1954, Zhang took up the position of Director of the Department of Security, continuing his contribution to the stability of Xikang. Under Zhang's guidance, the Xikang government was checked by strong, auditory power he personally supervised, ridding Xikang of the plague of corruption that would have otherwise been disastrous to its infant economy. His manipulation of religious policies also won the support of many, a foundation upon which Liu's ambitious projects may be executed. After 1954, Zhang Weijiong sided with neither the Nationalists nor the Communists, instead of taking a nonpartisan position as an apolitical strongman that defends Xikang from evil within or without."

 XIK_tongqu_of_two_worlds_desc:0 "Xikang is the last Avenue of trade and communication between the two increasingly alienating Chinas, whilst Xikang benefits from it, acquiring goods otherwise unable to manufacture. Under Liu's careful management, Xikang benefitted greatly as a middleman from the quasi international trading, and the two worlds, ever hostile, maintained a grey trading partnership that neither side are willing to admit. All of this is constantly helping build up Ya'an from an irrelevant town to a true regional hub of trade."
 XIK_new_xikang:0 "New Xikang"
 XIK_new_xikang_desc:0 "It has been more than two decades since Xikang was made a province, and from then much has changed in the once poor and unenlightened mountains. Emerging as a model province, Xikang's economy gradually transformed into a modern economy following Miao Yuntai's monopoly on drugs that forced local farmers to seek other cash crops. Industrialisation and electrification of Ya'an and Xichang followed quickly, and with physical wealth comes that of the mind. Democracy and the concept of the rights of man are no longer abstract ideas, and all political forces in Xikang knew it would take more than just empty promises to satisfy the demands of the Chinese people."
 XIK_24th_army_nra:0 "The 24th Army"
 XIK_24th_army_nra_desc:0 "The Xikang Province remains a military junta, even when taking account of its surprising leniency on the opposition. Xue Yue and Zhang Zhihe may have household troops of their own alongside the 74th, but the 24th Army remains as the chief leader of Xikang politics. As of now, neither Kuomintang nor the Communists pose more threat than the Weimin Society, Chairman Liu's own political party. If Liu Wenhui completely sidelines the 24th, it might as well as shift from the defender of Xikang to its biggest threat."
 XIK_panchen_lama_in_exile:0 "Panchen Lama in Exile"
 XIK_panchen_lama_in_exile_desc:0 "The 9th Panchen Lama's presence in Ya'an was highly troublesome, even in his death prior to reincarnation. The guards of Panchen Lama and the minority attempted a coup on the 24th Army, but were soon put down. Immediately after the 10th Panchen Lama's ascension in Yushu, he was expelled by the Tibetan army, for he was an enemy of the Kashag of Jokhang. Seeking refuge in Xikang, the 10th Panchen Lama is not expecting a swift return to Lhasa any time soon, though his maturity and popularity is also beginning to stir trouble as his previous corporeal form did."
 XIK_restless_elite:0 "Restless Local Elite"
 XIK_restless_elite_desc:0 "Before even the foundation of Xikang, the minority elite of Xikang, who had deep connections with Chiang Kai-shek attempted to subvert Liu's rule through the so-called Kang Self-Governance Movement. Though the elite has lost their influence since the Garze Incident under the lead of Liu Jiaju, since the foundation of the binary regime Golmud has been ever forging a stronger bond with Ya'an. And those who thought their time was over became once more agitated, especially in the Kang regions, a notion that must not develop unchecked."
 XIK_costs_of_peace:0 "The Costs of Peace"
 XIK_costs_of_peace_desc:0 "Liu Wenhui was never an easily satiated man. Though the mountains of Xikang are flowing with gold, his ambition reaches far higher than even their highest peaks. The sole purpose of developing Xikang was, is, and will always be retaking the Sichuan basin, as he rightfully deserves. Though Chairman Liu knows his men can easily best the Sichuanese, it is no longer merely an issue of China. Long has the possibility of a Japanese intervention haunted him. Liu Wenhui might emerge as a great man of Sichuan and potentially the entirety of China, but for now, Liu wouldn't be returning to Chengdu anytime soon."

#Events
xik.1.t:0 "Ya'an calls for aid!"
xik.1.d:0 "Shocking news today, as clashes sounded within the central Ya'an police station, resulting in the police within the building being expelled! Fearing a greater uprising the governor immediately called for martial law and urgently called for Wenhui to reinforce the city. These fears however seem to have been overblown, with the only extra disturbances being petty criminals with incredibly bad timing. Nonetheless the police station has now been occupied and barricaded by the group, and wenhui's orders have been requested on how to respond to this siege."
xik.1.a:0 "Who is it that has done this?"
xik.5.t:0 "Siege in Ya'an Police Station"
xik.5.d:0 "Arriving in the city Wenhui has asked for further clarification of the situation, only to find himself more confused than before. The station windows have been covered in Chinese republican flags, images of dragons, lotuses and other nationalist symbols, and even a large hand drawn portrait of Liu Wenhui draped over the front doors. Additionally it has been reported by the recently evicted officers that many of the usurpers were quite young, teenagers and some quite well dressed. Whatever their goals it is assumed by our chief of police that they will soon gain access to the weapons safe if they have not already, and urges us to crush the rebellion before it gains weapons and allies. The police blockade stands ready, whatever we choose."
xik.5.a:0 "It can't hurt to hear them out, order them to account for themselves."
xik.5.b:0 "Whatever their goals, they have far overstepped. Crush them."
xik.6.t:0 "Police Have Been Thrown Back!"
xik.6.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events the initial police assault upon the occupied station has failed to retake the building! Though the initial barricade has been torn down our police were stopped within the doorway as they were pelted from above and crushed by the surprisingly dedicated student mob. Thankfully no lethal weaponry was used despite fears that they may have gotten hold of the armory, but several men have been wounded regardless. Whatever the reason: unwillingness to harm students, shock at the energetic pushback, or just poor planning on the part of our over eager chief two things are clear: we need to train the men in riot control and the occupation is still not over."
xik.6.a:0 "If the police were too soft to do the job, the army will have to take a shot!"
xik.6.b:0 "One more chance for the men to redeem themselves. They were caught off guard is all"
xik.6.c:0 "This is pointless! Let's hear what they have to say: they have earned as much"
xik.7.t:0 "Success in full!"
xik.7.d:0 "Upon seeing the disciplined rows of uniformed soldiers, armed with lethal rifles and grenades, the fight went out of Liao. So, their statement had fell on deaf ears. The gamble had failed: Xikang would continue to be ruled by the shallow, the traitorous and the missguided and China would once more be stabbed in the back. With a heavy heart Liao rose to his feet and with hands above his head walked out of the station: he would not die for a failed cause.\n\nWith his surrender hardliners began to fight with those who attempted to follow Liao crying traitor, coward, and any other insult they could imagine. In this broken unity the troops swept into the station, quickly overwhelming the students with scarcely a shot fired. By the end of the day two students lay dead, one soldier had a nasty black eye and the police station had been freed."
xik.7.a:0 "Finally"
xik.8.t:0 "What to do with the prisoners?"
xik.8.desc:0 "We now have on our hands tens of students of varied well being waiting for their fate to be revealed to them. All that is left is for Wenhui to decide what the price of such insubordination should be."
xik.8.a:0 "Put them in prison until the war is over"
xik.8.b:0 "A public beating should suffice to remind these children to behave"
xik.8.c:0 "Simply expel them from their school, that's where these radicals come from"
xik.8.d:0 "They have learned their lesson: send them back home and let their parents know what happened"
xik.9.t:0 "The bonfire"
xik.9.d:0 "Disaster! The students resolve did not crack upon seeing the arrival of regular troops, and so the business of breaching and retaking the police station began. Room to room Wenhui's army proved more than a match for the amateur students until one made a most ill advised decision. Throwing a Zhdanov cocktail into the mass of soldiers the fire quickly spread out of control engulfing the first floor of the building as the troops quickly retreated from the blaze. The students were not so lucky as their own barricades caught them behind the flames and the police station quickly became a charnel house for the students.\n\nWhile a fire response team was immediately summoned and has ensured the flames will not spread to the city it is yet to be seen how many, if any, will be able to survive the blaze and the building itself has been gutted."
xik.9.a:0 "Horrible!"
xik.10.t:0 "Burying the corpses"
xik.10.d:0 "As the last embers guttered out retrieval work began its grizzly business. Through smoke inhalation, burning and even a suicide not one body has been found alive and most are unrecognizable. It seems that all there remains to do is find a resting place for the bodies."
xik.10.a:0 "Contact the families, it is only right."
xik.10.b:0 "Get rid of these bodies quickly and discreetly. This is not something to remember."
xik.9999.t:0 "Parents Vigil"
xik.9999.desc:0 "Today the families of the deceased have decided to hold a vigil in remembrance of the dead students. Holding lanterns and candles they have taken to the streets in somber silence bringing with them children, elderly and even a few effigies of their departed sons. No slogans, no chants, simply a deep and heart wrenching sense of loss presented to the darkened city. Gatherings of this size are illegal within Ya'an but it may be best to simply let this one pass. Especially as many members are rather affluent members of our society..."
xik.9999.a:0 "Politely, but firmly tell them to disperse. Now"
xik.9999.b:0 "Let them grieve without disturbance. Hopefully that will be the end of this."
xik.9999.c:0 "These people are important. Wenhui shall join them in their remembrance of this tragedy"
xik.11.t:0 "They threaten a bomb!"
xik.11.d:0 "The second attempt at forcing through the student mob has proven far more successful than the first, and after a brief but vicious battle of clubs and teargas most students have either been taken into custody or rendered unfit for continued resistance. Only a handful of students remain in revolt, and in desperation it seems they have turned to desperate measures. Who we can only assume to be the leader has threatened to blow up himself and anyone near him should any attempt be made on the boiler room he is barricaded in, and has put forth his demands for an audience with Wenhui. While it is unknown if the threat is credible most everyone is against Wenhui going any closer to the potential threat fearing an attempt on his life, for whatever reason. However there are a few who say this is the only way to deescalate the situation, and some who still think this was all unnecessary bloodshed in the first place..."
xik.11.a:0 "They're bluffing: breach the room. This ends now."
xik.11.b:0 "There are far better ways to kill a general than this. Let us try to talk the boy down."
xik.12.t:0 "The station retaken"
xik.12.d:0 ""
xik.13.t:0 "The students demand to see Wenhui!"
xik.13.d:0 "The police lieutenant sent to make contact with the besieged has returned somewhat flustered to us. The only message he claims they would give him was "The students shall only present their case to the general Wenhui, not to any third party." At the very least it has become clear that the besieged are students, a fact made all the clearer by the pleas of a bedraggled professor who begged for violence to not be used against his wayward students until being temporarily detained. We still are no closer to understanding the motivations of these students, nor do we know what they will do once Wenhui is in sight..."
xik.13.a:0 "We gave them a chance. Send in the assault." 
xik.13.b:0 "I asked for their statement, and I mean to get it. I'm going in"
xik.13.c:0 "Perhaps their teachers can talk some sense into them. The geologist seems honest."
xik.14.t:0 "Students want to meet elsewhere"
xik.14.d:0 "For the past few hours various faculty from the local university have pleaded with the student rebellion to stand down, or at least open a dialogue with them. It seems that their pleas, backed up by a show of force from the anxious police chief, have had some effect. When the school faculty returned to Wenhui's location the deal offered by the students had been altered. Though they still refused to speak with anyone but Wenhui himself they have agreed to leave the station unarmed on the condition that the general himself appear and give his word that he will hear their case."
xik.14.a:0 "They shall state their demands on our terms or not at all!"
xik.14.b:0 "This will get the students out of their fortifications at least."
xik.15.t:0 "Students refuse to move"
xik.15.d:0 "Perhaps expectedly negotiations have ground to a standstill as the students will hear no more reason. The chief of police has in the meantime become ever more shrill as rumours spread like wildfire across Ya'an and the students defensive measures grow ever tighter. There is nothing more to be done, the students must be dragged out by their hair and into the light of the law."

xik.17.t:0 "How, and who, to punish"

xik.17.d_sympathetically:0 "While their actions are treasonous it would be wrong to punish severely simply for an overabundance of patriotism. Additionally it is true that any other means of reaching Wenhui likely would have failed.
