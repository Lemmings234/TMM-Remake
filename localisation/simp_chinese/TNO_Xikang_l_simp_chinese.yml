 POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "刘文辉生于1895年，是一个彻头彻尾的军人。他于1916年毕业于保定军校，自保定回川后，投入刘存厚川军麾下，1926年加入国民党后，在国军内迅速崛起，被提拔为国民革命军第24军军长，1929年被任命为四川省政府主席。省内军阀林立，令四川省十分不稳。通过远交近攻、阴谋暗害，以及武力威慑，刘文辉成功稳定其在四川省的绝对地位。然而，在1934年，他却被他的侄子刘湘赶出四川，逃往西康担任建省委员会委员长。刘湘与蒋介石关系就如四川本身与蒋的关系一般摇摇欲坠，他甚至多次拒绝蒋介石的命令。\n\n抗战期间，刘文辉稳扎稳打，没有让部队轻易冒进，日本人攻至四川时，刘文辉虽是四川最后的大军阀，但却选择召集部队，撤退至西康，在小城西昌扎营。刘文辉拒绝向日本投降，日本人也认为这个山区小省无足轻重，没必要耗费兵力攻打。\n\n日本攻克四川数十年后的今日，刘文辉作为中华大地仅存的独立军阀之一孤立无援。四川就在西康边上，或许受到中央政权的直接控制，但四川已再次陷入动荡，各式各样的势力都在争夺四川的控制权。刘文辉想要见到一个自由的中国，但手下却极力阻止。他们认定与日本作战，无异于自杀。或许只有奇迹，才能让刘文辉得以重新拿起武器……"

The station windows have been covered in Chinese republican flags, images of dragons, lotuses and other nationalist symbols, and even a large hand drawn portrait of Liu Wenhui draped over the front doors. Additionally it has been reported by the recently evicted officers that many of the usurpers were quite young, teenagers and some quite well dressed. Whatever their goals it is assumed by our chief of police that they will soon gain access to the weapons safe if they have not already, and urges us to crush the rebellion before it gains weapons and allies. The police blockade stands ready, whatever we choose."

Though the initial barricade has been torn down our police were stopped within the doorway as they were pelted from above and crushed by the surprisingly dedicated student mob. Thankfully no lethal weaponry was used despite fears that they may have gotten hold of the armory, but several men have been wounded regardless. Whatever the reason: unwillingness to harm students, shock at the energetic pushback, or just poor planning on the part of our over eager chief two things are clear: we need to train the men in riot control and the occupation is still not over."

The gamble had failed: Xikang would continue to be ruled by the shallow, the traitorous and the missguided and China would once more be stabbed in the back. With a heavy heart Liao rose to his feet and with hands above his head walked out of the station: he would not die for a failed cause.\n\nWith his surrender hardliners began to fight with those who attempted to follow Liao crying traitor, coward, and any other insult they could imagine. In this broken unity the troops swept into the station, quickly overwhelming the students with scarcely a shot fired. By the end of the day two students lay dead, one soldier had a nasty black eye and the police station had been freed."

Room to room Wenhui's army proved more than a match for the amateur students until one made a most ill advised decision. Throwing a Zhdanov cocktail into the mass of soldiers the fire quickly spread out of control engulfing the first floor of the building as the troops quickly retreated from the blaze. The students were not so lucky as their own barricades caught them behind the flames and the police station quickly became a charnel house for the students.\n\nWhile a fire response team was immediately summoned and has ensured the flames will not spread to the city it is yet to be seen how many, if any, will be able to survive the blaze and the building itself has been gutted."

Holding lanterns and candles they have taken to the streets in somber silence bringing with them children, elderly and even a few effigies of their departed sons. No slogans, no chants, simply a deep and heart wrenching sense of loss presented to the darkened city. Gatherings of this size are illegal within Ya'an but it may be best to simply let this one pass. Especially as many members are rather affluent members of our society..."

 xik.11.d:0 "The second attempt at forcing through the student mob has proven far more successful than the first, and after a brief but vicious battle of clubs and teargas most students have either been taken into custody or rendered unfit for continued resistance. Only a handful of students remain in revolt, and in desperation it seems they have turned to desperate measures. Who we can only assume to be the leader has threatened to blow up himself and anyone near him should any attempt be made on the boiler room he is barricaded in, and has put forth his demands for an audience with Wenhui. While it is unknown if the threat is credible most everyone is against Wenhui going any closer to the potential threat fearing an attempt on his life, for whatever reason. However there are a few who say this is the only way to deescalate the situation, and some who still think this was all unnecessary bloodshed in the first place..."

We still are no closer to understanding the motivations of these students, nor do we know what they will do once Wenhui is in sight..."

 xik.14.d:0 "For the past few hours various faculty from the local university have pleaded with the student rebellion to stand down, or at least open a dialogue with them. It seems that their pleas, backed up by a show of force from the anxious police chief, have had some effect. When the school faculty returned to Wenhui's location the deal offered by the students had been altered. Though they still refused to speak with anyone but Wenhui himself they have agreed to leave the station unarmed on the condition that the general himself appear and give his word that he will hear their case."
