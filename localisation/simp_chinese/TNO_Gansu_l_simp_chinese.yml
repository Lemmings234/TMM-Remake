 POLITICS_MASANOBU_TSUJI_DESC:0 "If one were to ask a high-school student in Kanazawa or Nagano or Osaka about Tsuji Masanobu, the result would be a glowing review. To Japanese from Kamikawa to Kitakyushu and beyond, General Tsuji is a war hero, a great champion of the Pan-Asian dream, who freed Malaya from the British imperialist bastards through his innate genius and cunning planning.\n\nThe real Tsuji, the one known to the oppressed from Davao to Lanzhou, is far different. He is a ruthless, brutish mass murderer, a butcher in willing, fanatical service to a new imperialism. True, he is the general that planned the invasion of Malaya and brought it to completion in a month. But that was done in an orgy of cruelty and brutality that painted streets from Alor Setar to Kota Tinggi in blood time and again.\n\nAnd that was not the end, for bleeding Malaya white once was not enough for Tsuji. Since then, he has partaken in a multitude of massacres and targeted genocides, not least among these the brutal Sook Ching – Purging-through-Cleansing – of Chinese Malayans and Chinese in Singapore, and the terrible Bataan Death March in which prisoners died or were slain like flies.\n\nNow, after some time spent in Japan, the old brute is let out of the doghouse to tear people to shreds once more. The Imperial Japanese Army headquarters have dispatched him and a Northwestern Area Army to pacify the unruly northwest of China. He will do so with gusto, partaking eagerly in yet another festival of blood and murder. A rapacious, iron-fisted, ruthless, and conscienceless brute is needed to defeat the last bastions of Chinese resistance, and one could not ask for a better example of that than Tsuji Masanobu."

 GAN_the_seihoku_desc:0 "Unlike the privileged servicemen of the Imperial Japanese Army, the Seihoku-Shina Homengun, or the Northwest China Army Group seldom knew concepts like 'peace' or 'codes of conduct'. Ever since 1947, 1st, 12nd and 43rd Army, alongside the 13rd Air Division that make up the Seihoku Homengun have been stationed in the Chinese Northwest, tasked with suppressing the neverending waves of rebellion.\n\nForged in such hostile conditions, the Army features a far more efficient system of supply and organisation. With the countryside unfriendly, the Seihoku Homengun has adapted its supply lines and doctrines to fight efficiently in conditions that would otherwise only appear in nightmares of IJA maintenance corps."
