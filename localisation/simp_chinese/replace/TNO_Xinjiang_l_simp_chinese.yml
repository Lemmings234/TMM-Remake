 The_Crumbling_Six_Policies: "摇摇欲坠的六大政策"
 The_Crumbling_Six_Policies_desc: "六大政策，即“反帝、亲苏、和平、清廉、建设、民族平等”，曾经是盛世才治理新疆的总纲领，如今则已随着西西伯利亚共和国的崩溃彻底成为了废纸一张。由于督理政府再未出台新的纲领性文件，六大政策在名义上仍是盛世才的施政纲领，但它早已不合时宜。摆在我们面前的只有两个选择，要么重新解释六大政策，要么干脆就把它彻底扔进垃圾堆。"
 Where_Are_They: "他们在哪儿？"
 Where_Are_They_desc: "Counter-bandit warfare is supposedly one of the key roles of the Governate-General, but it is now increasingly apparent that the Sheng regime has not necessarily eliminated insurgents. The ranks of the Communists grow by the day, living off mountains and woods in the shadow. Though the urban centres are firmly subservient, Large swaths of northern Xinjiang are in anarchy. Few know where the Reds emerge, and fewer still know what is their ultimate goal."
 Faded_Modern_Civilization: "远去的现代文明"
 Faded_Modern_Civilization_desc: "Xinjiang, alongside northern parts of Central Asia, were integral to the Siberian Plan, and the province reaped great benefits by tying its economy with the Soviet Union. Such an arrangement collapsed very quickly after the Russian surrender, leaving Xinjiang's export-oriented industry bankrupt overnight. Many a machine tool lies idle in rusted factories, recollecting times of glory that was going to transfer to Xinjiang. Years after the economic collapse, these tarnished metal giants lie in slumber still as monuments to what once was. Modern, industrialised civilisation looked upon the Northwest and found it wanting."
 Orphan_of_Asia: "亚细亚的孤儿"
 Orphan_of_Asia_desc: "Sheng's rapprochement of the Co-Prosperity Sphere was out of optimism. While the Japanese are incapable of reaching his province, it would at least not deny chances to further expansion of its influence into Central Asia.\nDespite repeated attempts, the Empire displays no interest in Xinjiang, where the hostile environment and lack of control of the countryside mean no natural resource exploitation would go on without great threats to the security of Japanese investments. It remains a question whether Xinjiang should continue courting with Japan or seek some other benefactors."
