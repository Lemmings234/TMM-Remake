Although the new Republic sought to build a Han national state, claims from Imperial era are still relevant and enforced by Chinese diplomats even unto the new century. Whilst some patches of useless land are barely useful, other regions are of military or economic importance. China has absolutely no intention of sabre-rattling with India or Central Asia for some sparsely populated land, it still still refuses to recognise these territories as foreign.\n\n§YIf we gain regional prominence, however, just maybe, we can sit down with our neighbours to discuss these disputed territories in the future.§!"

 QIN_Beijiang_tt:0 "§GBEIJIANG - XINJIANG PROVINCE§! \n\nWith Northern Xinjiang finally flying our flags, the Kazakhs for now have respected our overlordship over them. It is now that we should employ our ancient wisdom of the School of Diplomacy to divide and conquer the various people through rewarding the good-behaving villages and applying soft or hard sanctions on those who resist. If all goes well, we can attempt to ally with the more educated elites of Dzungars and employ them to our government to show our committment of liberating the peoples rather than oppressing them."
 QIN_Tibet_tt:0 "§GWEIZANG - TIBET PROVINCE§! \n\nThe homeland of the Tibetan civilisation itself, Ü-Tsang is surprisingly uninhabited except for Xigazê and the great city of Lhasa. Its arid climate and highest average elevation of all three regions of Tibet, it is absolutely unsuitable for human survival, yet the nomads thrive through trading with the Indians and Nepali. The capture of Weizang secures our control over the source of the Indus, the Ganges and the Yarlung Tsangpo. One day, we shall reclaim the lost Nanzang from the Indians, whether through negotiations or force."
 QIN_Hexi_tt:0 "§GHEXI - GANSU PROVINCE§! \n\n With the Corridor secured and old infrastructure rebuilt, Hexi Corridor will prove to be a critical area that must be manned at all times. Another interesting aspect that just came to light is the great amount of ancient artifcats collected by Tsuji and kept in Jiuquan for unknown reasons. Perhaps these rafts of old can provide assistance to the Chinese of modern era!"
 QIN_Nanjiang_tt:0 "§GNANJIANG - XINJIANG PROVINCE§! \n\nXinjiang is largely under our control now, but the matter of ethnic tension is far from resolved. Uyghur people are still angry towards the Chinese for their conquest and their attitude towards them. If we are to bring peace to this land, the Government will have to recognise differences and work with them. \n\n§RBefore drastic approaches become necessary.§!"
 QIN_Hami_tt:0 "§GHAMI - XINJIANG PROVINCE§! \n\nNow Hami is brought back into the reach of the Republic for the first time in decades, and so are the people. However, having lived under Sheng Shicai and Zhang Zhizhong regimes, they would still be likely to protest against centralised government intervening in their daily life. Therefore, to pacify Hami some measures of autonomy would be highly beneficial before we pull the strings gradually to further utilise the commerce for purchasing weapons of liberation."
 QIN_Gansu_tt:0 "§GLANZHOU - GANSU PROVINCE§! \n\nWith Gansu liberated, we are now directly bordering the Nanjing regime, and there is little seclusion of the existence of Northwest Government and its intentions. Rapidity is the essense of war, and taking advantage of their unreadiness and study their weakness is key to victory. For we shall show our armies faraway to the traitors when the soldiers of liberation march into Shaanxi!"
 QIN_Ningxia_tt:0 "§GNINGXIA PROVINCE§! \n\nUnlike provinces of the west, we estimate no hardship in stabilising this area due to the crimes committed by the Japanese. But we nonetheless need to reinvest into Ningxia, for its lands are salted, its cities depopulated, its cities broken. However, it is obvious that the remaining men are no shy in defending our regime to the last drop of their blood, so we can expect increased manpower from Ningxia and surrounding areas."
 QIN_Qinghai_tt:0 "§GQINGHAI - QINGHAI PROVINCE§! \n\nLiterally 'Azure Sea', Qinghai is named after the Qinghai Lake in the heartland of the province. Traditionally outside of the Eighteen Provinces of Han, it is a highly diverse land with many ethinic groups present and a range of religion practiced. Home of the §GNorthwest Government§!."

 QIN_Yushu_tt:0 "§GYUSHU - QINGHAI PROVINCE§! \n\nLiterally 'Jade Tree', Yushu is directly adjacent to U-Tsang region of Tibet and is thus largely inhabited by Tibetans. Part of the Amdo region of Tibet, its ownership exchanged frequently. In early 1930s it was seized by Qinghai warlord Ma Bufang, but retaken after the fall of the Republic of China. With our recovery of this key territory, we are in a firm stance to reconquer other provinces."
 QIN_Khams_tt:0 "§GKANG - TIBET PROVINCE§! \n\nOne of the three regions of Tibet, Kang Region is sparsely inhabited save for Changdu, and otherwise unimpressive. Or so would an uneducated outisider say. Nearly every major river in East Asia find their origins in the mountains of Kang, feeding millions downstream. Thus the annexation of this land signifies not only the Chinese will remains indestructible as ever, but also provides us with a leveraging tool of utmost importance with regimes of the East."

 QIN_Xikang_tt:0 "§GXIKANG PROVINCE§! \n\n'West of the Kang', this province, unlike neighbouring Sichuan which has been known for centuries, is a relatively young geological concept. After the Simla Convention, it is clear that Tibetans are trying to get Tibetan inhabited part of Sichuan for themselves. In a way to weaken them, China created the Xikang out of Sichuanese and Tibetan lands, covering all of Kham (Eastern Tibet). However, the name of the province is no longer accurate, as Tibet has long seized the actual western portion of Kham. Home of the §GXikang Clique§!, led by Liu Wenhui. \n\n§RNote Xikang Province is owned by your ally Liu, so you do not need to manage this region.§!"
 QIN_Beijiang_2_tt:0 "§RZÜÜNGAR§! \n\nThe land of Dzungaria, named after the Dzungars, a people closely related to Oirats and Kazakhs of Central Asia inhabits Northern Xinjiang. Dzungars once controlled a good portion of Xinjiang till the Qianlong Emperor's armies brought these lands under the Yellow Dragon. Unlike the Uyghurs to the south, the Dzungars are heavily influenced by foreign cultures, being one of the few ethnicities in China still using Cyrillic script from the long gone united Russia. It should be no surprise then that many of them had connections to Bukharin's Union, and have been constantly sending volunteers to Kazakh Red Army even to this day. Perhaps we do not need arms to convince them to work for us..."
 QIN_Tibet_2_tt:0 "§RÜ-TSANG REGION§! \n\nThe homeland of the Tibetan civilisation itself, Ü-Tsang is surprisingly uninhabited except for Xigazê and the great city of Lhasa. Its arid climate and highest average elevation of all three regions of Tibet, it is absolutely unsuitable for human survival, yet the nomads thrive through trading with the Indians and Nepali. Long have the people of this land remain free from outsiders, but for the sake of China, this will change."
 QIN_Hexi_2_tt:0 "§RHEXI CORRIDOR§! \n\nUnder the protection of the ancient Great Wall, Hexi Corridor provides the only possible route for China to reach the West for thousands of years. Now it is one of Tsuji's most stalwart fortresses out there in the desert, always vigilant. However, it would be impossible for him to always maintain such a long supply route, and our cavalry may be able to do just the opposite..."
 QIN_Nanjiang_2_tt:0 "§RSHINJANG§! \n\nXinjiang or Chinese Turkestan and the Uyghur people that roams this land are as alien to Han Chinese as Russians or Buryats. This part of Xinjiang, or Nanjiang (South Xinjiang) features a desert landscape ocassionaly dotted with oases, and is overwhelmingly Uyghur despite Zhang Zhizhong's effort. His pointless sinofication ruined Sheng Shicai's legacy of cooperation of peoples, and brought the ethinic tension in Xinjiang to a boiling point. It is only a question of when would Xinjiang descend into total chaos. §RAs per ancient idiom, the Chinese Government in Exile must not sit across the river and watch the raging fire, lest we lose Xinjiang forever!§!"
 QIN_Hami_2_tt:0 "§RQUMUL§! \n\nQumul, located on the eastern fringes of the old Xinjiang Province, is right at the end of the Hexi Corridor in Northwestern China. A gate to Central Asia, Qumul is not necessarily heavily populated, but certainly prosperous. It also helps that Qumul is one of the few places where Han Chinese and Hui people enjoy absolute majority in numbers. We can use this fact and use democratic means to secure the control over this province by simply call for a referendum of self-determination. Taking over this region would be crucial if we are to march into the rest of Xinjiang without serious supply issues."
 QIN_Gansu_2_tt:0 "§RGANSU§! \n\nGansu, one of the provinces of Xibei San Ma is now the beating heart of the artificial state that is Hui. Located on the eastern end of the Hexi Corridor, Gansu is home to the great cities of Lanzhou and Tianshui. Saying Tsuji controlling the Northwest trade would be a great understatement, but through establishing connections to the outside world elsewhere could weaken his position. Rich or not, Gansu must be taken if we are to bring justice to the traitor regime of Nanjing!"
 QIN_Ningxia_2_tt:0 "§RNINGXIA PROVINCE§! \n\nPagoda of the Temple that Upholds the Sky's bell ring its tones no more, for hope has been extinguished in the ancient city of Liangzhou and the oases of Ningxia. At a strategic crossroad on the Hexi Corridor, Liangzhou (or Wuwei) has been heavily garrisoned by General Tsuji's forces to defend against Ma incursions. And thus, his grip on the land is as strong as Gansu itself. And with this control comes tales of nightmarish stuff from the refugees fleeing West. Not much is known about Liangzhou or the city of Silver Rivers, for it appears almost completely radio silent."
 QIN_Yushu_2_tt:0 "§RYÜXÜ - AMDO REGION§! \n\nLiterally 'Jade Tree', Yushu is directly adjacent to U-Tsang region of Tibet and is thus largely inhabited by Tibetans. Part of the Amdo region of Tibet, its ownership exchanged frequently. In early 1930s it was seized by Qinghai warlord Ma Bufang, but retaken after the fall of the Republic of China. With Tibetans frequently patrolling this land, the capital of Qinghai, §GGolmud§! is constantly under threat of invasion."
 QIN_Khams_2_tt:0 "§RKHAMS REGION§! \n\nOne of the three regions of Tibet, Kham is sparsely inhabited save for Qamdo, and otherwise unimpressive. Or so would an uneducated outisider say. Nearly every major river in East Asia find their origins in the mountains of Kham, feeding millions downstream. Having been separated from Tibet briefly during the 1930s and 40s, the inhabitants, or Khams Pa, is certain not going to give up their land without a proper fight."
