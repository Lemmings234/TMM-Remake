 SIC_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In the war against Japan few bleed and died as Sichuan did. Countless young men were drafted in China's defense, and the province rallied to Chiang-Kai-Shek and the republican banner. It was all for naught. By 1947 the Imperial Japanese Army had crushed their province, devastating both the land and the people. Finally, in 1949 it ceased to be under military administration and was handed over to Tian Songyao. Over the past decade the ruined province has slowly been rebuilt, and its devastated population has gradually recovered. Now Tian Songyao can finally begin the development and improvement of his native land and paint over the scars of war. But this time, it will be a Sichuan for the Sichuanese. He will not easily see his people slaughtered by Nanjing's command again."

 SIC_special_status_sichuan_desc:0 "Since Chiang Kai-shek's time, the political agenda of Sichuan was that of unification and centralisation. However, this unofficial policy was reversed by Japanese authorities, as a strong Sichuan would be the only line of defense between Japan and the potential resurgence of China in the west or east, both equally terrifying. This special status meant Japan allows Sichuan additional freedom as to its policies, budgets, and military than the Nanjing Government."
 SIC_thirty_years_of_nightmares_desc:0 "Counting his time under Chiang and the Sphere, He Guoguang has served as the chief mediator in Sichuan for well over thirty years, working around the clock to solve conflicts between the Southwest, Nanjing, and Japan. An outsider, He has no invested interest in governing Sichuan, especially after the war, as his background ensured he would never advance his career further. Resignation is not an option, either, for he fears the threats of Japan, and Japan too fears what would become of this land without him."
 SIC_new_oligarch_caste_desc:0 "After Liu Xiang brought the unruly province under one nominal ruler, many private banks and companies with government backgrounds returned quickly to resume their business. Owing to their fast reaction, these companies achieved a monopoly within the province. Led by the tetrarchy of Meifeng, Chongqing, Minsheng, and Xingye, the Sichuanese oligarchs were also able to exploit the semi-independence status of Sichuan, preventing them from directly assaulted by Japanese Zaibatsus who'd have otherwise bankrupted most of them before their nascency. The Sichuanese oligarchs helped He Guoguang push through ambitious land reform projects and profited greatly from these ventures. As long as the province stays peaceful, there seems to be no definite limit as to how much the economy can grow."
 SIC_sichuanese_serfdom_desc:0 "In 1948, under the demand of Japanese occupation authorities and Zhou Fohai, the He Guoguang Regime was forced to coerce Sichuanese landowners to sell up to 40% of their lands to the state at dirty cheap prices, while the floods are yet to have ended. This land reformation soon turned political, as the former Sucheng Clique warlords and families were essentially stripped of everything. After pacifying the most troublesome local elites and officers, the Sichuan government organised purchased assets into state-owned lands, which are lent to countless thousands of peasants who were homeless and lacked the means to engage in farming without state aid. Although the regime has been surprisingly lenient on the serfs, they still do not own much and could be thrown into unemployment any second by the state, a tool that has been utilised by He to suppress the spread of extreme nationalism ever since 1948."
 SIC_fortress_world_sichuan_desc:0 "The original reason behind Sichuan's separation was to grant the very heart of southwestern trade quasi-independence, such that it may limit the RGOC from ever challenging Japan again. However, due to the presence of yet-to-be-subdued Liu Wenhui in the west, Sichuan also acts as a military bastion of the Sphere against possible Tibetan and Chinese counterattacks. Though Liu Wenhui was kept in check, the Baoding Clique only paid lip service, as Liu Wenhui too was a Baoding graduate. Due to this ambiguous relation, Sichuan is close to Liu Wenhui, but nominally still hostile towards the ROC-in-exile."
 SIC_sichuan_social_movement_2_desc:0 "Xiong Kewu's Popular Self-Defense Committee seems to have rallied many students under his banner, and in many universities where freedom of speech is exercised somewhat, anti-government protests and propaganda can be seen everywhere. But the situation remains under control for now. Those with work only see the students as rowdy troublemakers, and the problem only remains within the young, middle-class citizens. So long as we pay regular visits to these universities, the discontent amidst our general population is but a footnote."

 POLITICS_HE_GUOGUANG_DESC:0 "§YChief Executive of Sichuan§!\nThe §gKuomintang (Nanjing)§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 30th November 1885, Zhaoliqiao, Puqi County, Wuchang, Hunan Province§! \n\nHe Guoguang once felt his decision to flee Sichuan a good one, lest he becomes subordinate to Liu Xiang or even his enemy. A top graduate of the Sucheng Military School, he served in the New Army and participated in the Xinhai Revolution, but chose to leave for his home province of Hunan in furthering the revolution, putting the Sichuanese warlord identity behind him. Throughout his career, He Guoguang served many masters, but Chiang seems to be the last he followed willingly. He despised warlordism greatly. And thought acceptance into Nanjing means he can work towards the Three Principles and help unite Hunan and Sichuan for the Republic.\n\nAs Chiang's most trusted liaison in Sichuan, He Guoguang arrived at Chengdu with great enthusiasm and pride, but as soon as he'd sit down with his old classmates did he realise the scale of the trouble in front of him. For years, he'd have to use all his might and intelligence in the endless battle against the selfish, arrogant, and stubborn warlords. His greatest work, the Chuankang Meeting was blown away by the Japanese cannon the second day it convened. But at least there still was hope. Out of great danger, He thought, also comes opportunities for the wise. If Chiang Kai-shek was able to take over Guizhou, Sichuan would not be so different. \n\nSo he thought, till the untimely demise of Chiang Kai-shek and China.\n\nNowadays, He feels more stress and boredom than the times of the Xi'an Incident and the War. Having seen all modern China could offer, He's old heart is not intimidated by any sudden change in course of events, but instead by the same routine that he had for the past thirty years.\n\nHe contemplated, and thought what would have happened if he was one of them. Though he wouldn't rid himself of dishonour, at least he would be the master of his own fate."

 SIC_Deng_Xihou_hog_desc:0 "§YSecretary General of Sichuan§!\nThe §gBaoding Clique§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 24th May 1889, Huilong, Yingshan County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nDeng Xihou considers the prosperity and stability of Sichuan a feat entirely produced by his actions alone. He contributed to the Chengdu 'Uprising', and has since risen to prominence to become the true master of Sichuan, more so than even his previous lord Liu Xiang. Of course, as a fellow Baoding graduate, Deng Xihou seems to have never broken connection with Xikang, and has always been the first to receive any news about Xikang or Liu Wenhui himself. To that, Deng considers himself far from being a Hanjian, as opposed to what most would say. However, if Chairman Wang Jingwei calls himself 'Saving China by taking the Longer Route', the fact that he actively aided the retreat of the Nationalist-Communist coalition would certainly put him above many fellow officials in Nanjing.\n\nBut as the leading figure of Sichuan, Deng Xihou is quite content with the uti possidetis. He wishes that Nanjing never rises again; that Japan would never dominate nor stagnate; that Liu Wenhui and Ma Jiyuan never counterattack. Only then can he and Sichuan prosper and be free of plunder, anarchy, and misery."
 SIC_Xiong_Kewu_for_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Office of the Secretariat§!\n§NOld Kuomintang§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 26th December 1885, Yanjingwan, Jingyan County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nMany serve the Sichuanese government. Some may be seeking riches, whilst others desire to serve the nation. But not one would feel as much shame in their position as Xiong Kewu would. Xiong Kewu is said to cease conversation at the mere mention of the word Fangqu, for he is the architect of this accursed system back in 1920s. Had he faced the rebels toe-to-toe despite the odds, maybe the Sichuanese Army would have been united and powerful, instead of a toy of Yunnanese and eastern warlords. The army could have brought its entire might onto treacherous rebels, and China would have been able to beat back Japan.\n\nAfter the Chengdu Uprising, Deng Xihou invited Xiong who'd retired in Chengdu for a prestigious post. He initially sought to decline it but changed his mind. But it was not the power nor the money that swayed him. To use whatever renown he has and use all the strength he yet possesses in exchange for one, final chance of liberty and freedom for the beloved Motherland is all Xiong asks for. Using the regime change and brief chaos in Nanjing around 1952 as an excuse, Xiong created the Popular Self-Defense Committee, a progressive political group that has been nurtured and protected by Xiong Kewu ever since. Xiong Kewu feels great regret for the Fangqus, but he believes the Committee will not tread the same path."
 SIC_Liu_Hangchen_eco_desc:0 "§YDirector of the Office of Economics§!\nThe §BSucheng Clique§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 16th October 1896, Lu County, Sichuan Province§! \n\nThe Tetrarchy rules the economy with Sichuan with absolute power, yet one reigns even above them, for Liu Hangchen built the foundation on top of which the Sichuanese economy could operate smoothly. Originally a graduate of Peking University, Liu represented his family in negotiating deals with the leader of the Sucheng Clique Liu Xiang, who was so impressed he'd hire Liu Hangchen to take care of his financial affairs, eventually winning the trust of the Sucheng Clique and later all of Sichuan. For his military connections, Liu Hangchen was virtually untouchable in the entire Southwest.\n\nHis career temporarily halted due to the war, but quickly resumed after He Guoguang and Deng Xihou realised the work of Liu ran too deep for the two to somehow ignore and exclude him from the scene. The Sichuanese economy quickly recovered under the guidance of Director Liu, who has been at the helms of Sichuan for decades. \n\nA staunch Sucheng supporter, Liu Hangchen vehemently hates the Baoding Clique and Japan due to the death of his close friend Lu Zuofu over ten years ago, and has been since financing the Popular Self-Defense Committee to the point it became the most well-funded political organisation in the entire Reorganised ROC only after Wang's Kuomintang itself."
 SIC_Pan_Wenhua_sec_desc:0 "§YCommander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Provincial Guard§!\nThe §BSucheng Clique§!\n--------------\n§YBorn 11st November 1886, Renshou County, Zizhou, Sichuan Province§! \n\nPan Wenhua and Liu Hangchen are the only two Sucheng Clique officials to remain in the court of He Guoguang, but many consider he'd long since betrayed that Sucheng affiliation, for Pan, then acting mayor, was a direct perpetrator of the Chengdu Uprising, and joined with Deng Xihou in wiping Sucheng warlords, unifying Sichuanese army under Deng Xihou.\n\nSince those turbulent episodes, however, Pan increasingly withdrew himself from political matters important or minor. The reformation of Sichuanese army and his position as the commander of the garrison confirms his intention to stay in the military than mess with politics again. None knows if he ever felt regret for his action during that year, but as time passes and men age, Pan seems to be growing ever careless of these things of the past."

 #POLITICS_TIAN_SONGYAO_DESC:0 "It's not only clear to his immediate subordinates that Tian Songyao is a thoroughly indifferent man. Fears have sprouted concerning his potential death due to the fact that the tired warlord has not made a public appearance in weeks. However, Tian Songyao is alive and well, as his favorite concubine and his accountant know all too well. Every few months, an inordinate amount of money leaves the bank, and nobody says a word, for they assume the next banker knows something of it. And every few months, Tian's accountant takes in a few more bundles of cash.\n\nHowever, few blink much of an eye. Back east, in Nanjing, a few bureaucrats have raised a stink, but they have no authority in Chongqing. Very little information about positive developments aside from a few economic reports come out of sleepy Sichuan, but Tian is not so indifferent for no reason. After failing to stop the Communist Party of China in their Long March north, Tian fell out of favor with Chiang Kai-Shek and was left in minor commanding positions. Growing tired of losing battles during the war, Tian betrayed the KMT to Reorganized Chinese forces by fomenting a revolt within the Sichuan Clique.\n\nWhile he failed to secure the west and dislodge Wenhui, he succeeded in taking the populous and industrious east. In the end, it turned out this all went well, but the spoils of victory are entirely uninteresting to the man who has gained the moniker of "Winter Melon"."
